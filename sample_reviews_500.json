I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \n\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \n\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \n\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!", "date": "2017-01-14 21:30:33"}, {"review_id": "2TzJjDVDEuAW6MR5Vuc1ug", "user_id": "n6-Gk65cPZL6Uz8qRm3NYw", "business_id": "WTqjgwHlXbSFevF32_DJVw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I have to say that this office really has it together, they are so organized and friendly!

Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn't stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won't be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly.", "date": "2018-01-30 23:07:38"}, {"review_id": "fdiNeiN_hoCxCMy2wTRW9g", "user_id": "w31MKYsNFMrjhWxxAb5wIw", "business_id": "eU_713ec6fTGNO4BegRaww", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta.

What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.\n\nI'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a \"C\" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. \n\nMmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. \n\nThe jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. \n\nThey provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. \n\nNot gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside.

This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.\n\nSo at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....\n\nWe were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.\nThat's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.\n\nSo we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.\n\nIn summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else.

She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that! \n\nUgh, I don't care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!

However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.\n\nOk onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries.

There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well.

Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave.

Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.\n\nToo bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. \n\nThe playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! \n\nAfter a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the \"nice stuff\" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, \"Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?\" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.\n\nAfter carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff. \n\nSo, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime.

Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.\n\nI expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. \n\nTo top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing.

We, my boyfriend and I,  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.  \n\nSo we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how \"hot\" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable \"romantic\" evening of my life...\n\nNow to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a \"salad\", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.\n\n\nThe soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.\n\nThe appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!\n\nThe salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.\n\nThe meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.\n\nThe dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?\n\nThe wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...\n\nThe atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.\n\nWe finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! \n\nUpon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.\n\nWould I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.\n\nAnd to the lady we sat next to...Good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth.", "date": "2011-02-13 16:59:31"}, {"review_id": "_LPOtmfWnL_8_tL3ImhoLw", "user_id": "91DAiIKXri-41uzYue2hlg", "business_id": "w6F502EKMyn3ONbGT2bQxw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point.

Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said \"No\" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.\nThe worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in. We live 3 1/2 hours from Mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service, this was definitely not a pleasant experience", "date": "2018-03-15 20:12:39"}, {"review_id": "EedJ77WTwkytYhAR-PVMKQ", "user_id": "piYjHlLZQCtg9Q1QT0Lvbw", "business_id": "gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Five stars!

It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).\n\nHowever, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.\n\nIn general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend.

(You are old like me if you know that theme song!)\n\nHave you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.\n\nSome call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.\n\nReservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!\n\nBeing in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  \n\nSo if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  \n\nThe food:\n\nComplimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.\n\nCaesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.\n\nBread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  \n\nSpaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  \n\nLinguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.\n\nTiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.\n\nLemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.\n\nLadies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!\n\nTL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.

The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.\n\nThe enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were saut\u00e9ed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.\n\nWarning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy.

The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong.

The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \n\nLast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\n\nI paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \n\nWhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. \n\nI walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I'll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \n\nI honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\n\nI realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.", "date": "2014-01-17 03:27:38"}, {"review_id": "Y978JzDt7gcS0BaBTnd0NA", "user_id": "wsP41YZKPPvM7HQcUufz2w", "business_id": "WcM95CvBQCokDVM1M9rBWA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Just found out about this secret treasure!

Let me explain...\n\nThere are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. \n\nFOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \n\nI'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \n\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \n\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \n\nI won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.\n\nService: 4 stars\n\nKitch: 4 stars\n\nFood: 1 star", "date": "2013-06-24 06:42:29"}, {"review_id": "O4074JMW-wXUL4lsCWM2JA", "user_id": "zAxCqpH6zknQSRceUMuUfQ", "business_id": "w2xwgqHM7dJlHfyu4ouhBg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Azzip Pizza is literally SO good.

The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.\n\nI am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.\n\nCOBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!\n\nNow the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex\n\nI first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.\n\nI then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.\n\nI then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\n\nWhen I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.\n\nFinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\n\nI went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\n\nThe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \n\nI knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\n\nI suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.\n\nAs a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\n\nI went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \n\nThey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\n\nJared to the rescue:\n\nI took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\n\nLesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!\n\nCOBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF.

Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.\n\nThere're a few reasons I don't like it there:\n1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine/samples/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.\n\n2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.\n\n3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. \n\nI normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody.", "date": "2011-11-29 23:16:37"}, {"review_id": "a_g4eysuYC1pI9tv3MCZxA", "user_id": "QaN-nccbLZPWzownQYgTVQ", "business_id": "LzWROAt-RhgaBss4cOoDRQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 11, "funny": 3, "cool": 4, "text": "I love the West Side Market but I can't stand the crowds, the parking, and the general gentrified douchery that seems to accompany the entire process.

I don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood, but I'd like to shake their hand. It's just what the doctor ordered.\n\nImagine, if you will, a bright, airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region, rows of farm fresh eggs, coolers filled with Amish chicken and local ground beef...yeah, right. No, really, it's true. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but for an area of Cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air. It does what Cleveland and the rest of the nation needs, it encourages consumption of fresh, local foods. So what do they have to offer?\n\n-Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables with everything from plump bing cherries to more exotic fare like chayote and California avocados. \n\n-A bakery with Cleveland favorites like kugel and kolaczki and a deli stocked to overflowing with meats and cheeses from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\n-A bulk section with plenty of flour, rice, pie fillings, nuts, seeds, and other goodies.\n\n-Giant bags of peanuts, onions, apples, and carrots.\n\n-A wall of bulk candy packaged in little containers perfect for hiding in your cupboard behind the quinoa and flax seeds.\n\n-Reasonable prices. It's not as cheap as fast food, no. But if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health.\n\nI could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but I want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit. I know, it's not the West Side Market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway.

I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.\n\nWe walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  \n\nMy family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  \n\nIn the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.", "date": "2015-05-26 07:46:21"}, {"review_id": "snHJ1r0lIChCdTvtUHHKhA", "user_id": "7Gl4ah_uRVmXPro_J2PFRg", "business_id": "nZAJ2a2-Oyxt6GzX97i2pg", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food .

If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. \n\nOne really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. \n\nDefinitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.", "date": "2013-10-03 08:38:38"}, {"review_id": "XqFb2c5I4l8Q5SmQ30datA", "user_id": "MXwWj1pbG29aC3tFdyo7XA", "business_id": "R1jJQi2yR44D_2ileqr8kA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it!

These guys only care about your money and nothing more. When I joined I later had to cancel with them because I had to meet with my National Guard unit and I didn't know what kind of schedule I'd have. They seemed understanding and said it wasn't a problem. At this time I would have rated this gym very good, because I had fun with no issues. I even told them I'd probably start back up here after I know what schedule looked like. So I stop going after my month expired because I cancelled(even on my attendance sheet it said it was my last and only month.) I later check my bank statement and they charged me again, okay no big deal probably a mistake. I call them, no answer. Okay that's fine I'll email them explaining the mistake. I'll give them a few days to get back to me max. Hear nothing from them. Call them again, no answer. Call them again they finally answered. I explain the situation with guy that answers and he says \"Oh yeah i got your email but I forgot to call you.\". At this point I'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service. Then after that he tells me no I haven't cancelled and I'm going to have to pay another two months worth. He tells me I must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken English so he must have misunderstood me when I cancelled with him a month prior to this). He won't help me out at all, just says I have to pay more. Thank god I have Navy Federal for a bank because I call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me. They repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym, they also put a stop payment on the gym. Well sure and behold I get charged by them AGAIN and I call my bank asking why did this happen? Turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment. I ask what I can do. They say to email them so I have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie.

They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke.

So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table, which gave a much better view.\n\nThe show was def entertaining, with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome, something about a man in a g-string is just wrong, you know? but nonetheless, it was very entertaining. The emcee's accent was hot, and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate, and some of the older women too, which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well, so no matter where your seats were, I think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys.\n\nDownside though, at the end of the show, you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys, only to receive one picture. no offense, but that is a total rip off. i've been to Fantasy, which is a female stripshow,  and you can take pics with them for free, and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show, and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf?

I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help. \n\nSwamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again.

If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.\n\nIn most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.\n\nThe interiors and d\u00e9cor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.\n\nHats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet.", "date": "2015-07-03 20:26:12"}, {"review_id": "0y6G9k9mgwORZ0oK4hTEHg", "user_id": "1IhQLnq__TWCaMgDgoihJQ", "business_id": "M8a5DRdXl8KMu4bMFLPgQg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I have been going to this nail salon for 8 months now.

When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, \" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy\".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.

Definitely a hidden gem in the GTA. But please be very very careful and get everything in writing. George Christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of Crystal Fountain is very devious and sketchy. \n\nWe had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.\n\nFast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.\n\nWe called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as \"assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres\" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.\n\nWhen we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. \n\nNeedless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.\n\nPlease be very wary of this George, he is very unscrupulous.

For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \"butter\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!\nThe end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate.

Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.\n\nFor an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.\n\nI really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent.

When I walked in the store, I didn't know who the owner was, until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I'm not going to buy a large cake.

In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze.

The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.\n\nI also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. \n\nThey brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate.

It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)\n\nThere was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.\n\nOK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.

I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).
