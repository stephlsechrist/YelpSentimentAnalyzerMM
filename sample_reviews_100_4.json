NOW I get why!\n\nFinally braved the line-up to try out Wilbur this weekend.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be an off-night for their cash system which was down, so things felt a little chaotic.   It was cash only, which turned some people away.  I'm not sure if usually you go up to the counter to order, but this night, two people went around the lines taking orders and givng us our order number.  Then we waited to get to the cash, where we were told to repeat our orders while they used their calculators on their phones to charge us.  No receipts were available. \n\n(As an aside, this was totally an honour system.  One could've easily gotten away with not mentioning an item ordered and there'd be no tracking, if one was not an honest person!  Of course, with my bad luck, I realized (after I got home) that I was OVER-charged...maybe a typo on the calculator?  It was only a few bucks, so no harm, I suppose.)\n\nWith two of us eating, while I waited in line to pay, the other took up a table that had just been vacated and cleaned, to ensure we had seats, and promptly displayed our order number.  (On observation, seats turned over quickly, so I think even solo diners should not have trouble finding a spot to sit down.)  Even before I paid, the first order already arrived although we only got guac when we ordered (and paid for) guac and queso fundido.  This was quickly rectified.  Again, this may have been due to their system being down?\n\nAnyway, onto what's important...the food!  Actually I'm not sure I can add that much more to what others have already said.  Everything was SO delicious.  Of note is the fact that their guac does NOT have tomatos, which I prefer.  The queso fundido was so good, I was tempted to drink it like soup.  And the Mexican street corn - the bomb!  Their pineapple salsa is delicious, and the various hot sauces were so fun to try.\n\nAlso ordered were tacos (bulgogi and baja fish) and the S&T bowl.  The latter was super generous in shrimps (I counted 6 good-sized shrimps) and brisket.  I could not finish the bowl considering the amount of appetizers we had.  \n\nI have already made plans to go back to Wilbur and hopefully I will see how efficiently the ordering process runs when the computers are up and working!", "date": "2016-06-06 21:22:25"}, {"review_id": "-jS6wO1zRN-5ZsaKeYlStg", "user_id": "MzqIP6GLvHgMYcFySf9gGg", "business_id": "rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The atmosphere is fun.

I would've preferred the pork to not be such a block of meat as it made it a little harder to eat and tbh didn't look very appealing. However, it tasted realllllly good. The oiliness of the pork really complimented the softness of the bun but I wouldn't get it again for the price. ($6/bun!!)\n\nI ordered the extremely spicy noodles as I am a huge spice fanatic. They serve it with soy milk (which I think is actually so cute lol). Pretty thoughtful as the soy milk def helped tie the whole meal together when I was done!!

It was easy and convenient.  You walk through baggage claim to the Rental Car Shuttles, and there seems to always be one waiting (there were 4 lined up at the terminal entrance when we walked up - so nice not to have to wait for one, and there was a guy directing people to the front one :).  I think the shuttle services just one specific terminal (of the 3 that PHX has), so there's not multiple stops.  It then takes a (rather long) drive to the Rental Car facility, which is a GIANT parking structure with all the different rental car companies in it... nice facility, looks new, great AC, good signage.  Since we had done the Skip the counter, the confirmation tells you to take the escalator to level 2 and we were welcomed down there.\n\nThe greeters handed out FREE BOTTLE OF ICE WATER (which is like a TOTAL God-send after landing at Phoenix airport in the middle of summer... between the extreme heat and how much airports now sell water for!! and directed us to pick out our car from a certain row of vehicles... even gave tips that the \"cooler\" muscle cars were on one end.  That definitely peaked my husband's interest and we ended up with a Dodge Challenger.  glad he had fun driving it. Get in the car, proceed to exit booth, off you go\n\nTAKE CARE TO CHECK THE RECEIPT THEY GIVE YOU BEFORE PROCEEDING OUT OF THE EXIT BOOTH.  we were running late and hubby had exited before I noticed that the final recipt showed a charge of over twice what we were quoted... and since there was no way back, we ended up circling and going to back to the front desk of the rental car facility (thankfully, there is a parking/waiting lot, but its not the shortest walk when its 100+ degrees outside).  Turns out, the system didn't register the Costco discount for some reason, so they fixed it without complaints at the front desk (if we had noticed we could have had it fixed at the exit booth too).  So lesson learned, check the receipt before exiting.\n\nReturn was easy, though if you navigate to PHX directly, following the signs seems to take a LONG time to get to the rental car facility.  Not sure if you navigated directly there, that there would be a shorter route or not.  Quickly dropped off the car, and remember to get back on the correct shuttle for your terminal.\n\nEasy Peasy!

The staff was VERY friendly and helpful. My husband and I were traveling from Texas, and this was the first place, since leaving Texas, that had actual grass for our pup. We appreciate that La Quinta is pet friendly with no extra charge or limit to rooms. We were able to stay on the top floor, where it was splendidly quiet. We were also traveling in a large truck and trailer and found parking, simply. The bathroom was lovely and spacious. It was very clean, quiet, and comfy! We will stay here any time when we are passing through!", "date": "2016-06-27 19:59:05"}, {"review_id": "_J9msnaMa1DnqQD0-Vv1jA", "user_id": "YEb5ibe-AUNMcbPxRkm6hA", "business_id": "aVHClxgKDfGbw4j_yk24OA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Used to be Koreanna's. My wife and I frequented Koreanna's a number of times as we enjoyed their BBQ and soups. The only issue we had with Koreanna's was sometimes their service as the waitress there was not always pleasant and sometimes she'd give us the bill right in the middle of our meal. \n\nNow with new management, new servers, the atmosphere has changed for the better and the food is still great. All the servers are extremely courteous and welcoming. I've had the Bibimbap and the tofu soup, both were excellent. They offer a great variety of side dishes along with your meal.  I was there by myself for lunch on a weekday and had SIX side dishes all to myself (along with my Bibimbap)!  Have still yet to try the BBQ but that will be next on our list. A great Korean joint in Calgary.", "date": "2015-10-21 21:46:41"}]
