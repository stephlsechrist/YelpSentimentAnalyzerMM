The price was @$5.\n\nOne orders at the counter, pays, and receives a ticket. I didn't know what to do thereafter, so I just sat at the only open (dirty) table that was available. Eventually, about fifteen minutes later, someone called out my ticket number and I went all the way back to the entrance to pick up my order. \n\nOne picks up their orders immediately to the right of where one orders and pays for their food. This is a pretty screwed up system logistically, but since they've been doing business this way for 100 years, well........I don't guess that my opinion matters much. I just can't see this reverse, cluttered, traffic system as being the ideal way to manage customer flow - especially with all of their empty counter space past the registers. \n\nThe hot dogs were not good and not bad. The taste was okay, but they were only lukewarm and messy. They arrived wrapped in white wax paper in a brown paper bag. They were wrapped with zero regard to their appearance, and handed to me by a unsmiling young lady who look besieged. I can't say as I blame her, but personally, I would put a little more pride into the appearance of the food that I served.\n\nThe hot dogs looked like the bag had been thrown out the window of a moving vehicle. They were \"smushed\" all to heck. The buns were not toasted. Most of the toppings: chili, onions, mustard, and slaw were smeared all over the white paper wrapper. I ate the hot dogs because I was starving, but I wouldn't order them again. I've had gas station hot dogs that were better.\n \nAs I mentioned earlier, the restaurant was jammed, and every table was full. \n\nThe restaurant was not nearly as clean as I would have preferred. My table was filthy. There was a trash heap of French fries, napkins, and other debris under my table. There was salt and \"stuff\" all over my table top. A man came by with a broom and dust pan while I was getting my hot dogs, but he didn't clean the table. \n\nThe place looked to me like it could use a good steam cleaning. The white linoleum floor was yellowed, and overdue for a good buffing with a circular scrubber. The walls needed painting. Yeah, I know, the place is 100 years old. What do I expect? Answer: for it to be clean. Nitpicking? Maybe. \n\nI ordered a nut sundae for dessert. It was $4.00. It was okay, but the portion was a small 8-10 oz. plastic cup. An entire HUGE banana split was $5. \n\nTheir milkshakes are.....1950's colossal, I can see the appeal. \n\nMany younger people were ordering the grape flavor ice cream and shakes. \n\nThe man and woman at the order counter / register were friendly. The two \"soda jerks\" making ice cream confections were very professional and courteous. There was no shame in their game, although they didn't smile either. I don't know why, but somehow I felt that this place is a small version of the Varsity in Atlanta. \n\nParking is VERY limited. \n\nThe restaurant is extremely easy to find.\n \nWould I return? Yes, but only for ice cream or a shake.  Those items rate a four, and that's why one should come here. This place is first and foremost....an ice cream shop, and that's what they do best.", "date": "2015-03-12 21:13:02"}, {"review_id": "Pmpmq8Yys-7fXCOpwDL7Vw", "user_id": "OmjMNG77obZOKQ59o-Tx4Q", "business_id": "BLIJ-p5wYuAhw6Pp6mh6mw", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The rooms were very big and very clean.

We got seated around 8:10 and had about an hour to get our food before they took the food away, which was more than enough time. The buffet closes at 9pm but the food is taken away at 9:15pm (kind of early, no?). Overall the lineup of food was kind of meh for me, I was expecting more.Nothing really blew my mind away, nor did I see anything that had a \"wow\" factor. There were a few items that I did enjoy- all of the pastas were good. Bone marrow was alright. Fried chicken wings were great. Siracha chicken wings were not that great. French onion soup was ok, but a bit too salty. I wish they had a greater seafood selection. The buffet also came with complementary juices, coffee, and lemonade.

I remember having really fond memories of the meal that B and I had had there.  I remember we went there for Summerlicious and had such an amazing meal -- the service was great, the food was unique and delicious, and the portions were large too.  That still remains one of my favourite meals.  Thus, I was sad when I heard that they had shuttered their downtown location as I thought it was closed for good.  Fortunately, I found out later that they had simply relocated to the midtown area of Bathurst and Wilson.  Since then, I had been curious to return to it to try the food again.\n\nWe ordered two cocktails to start.  I had the Paese Collins, a cocktail with beefeater gin, lemon, and a thyme-infused syrou.  It was refreshing!  I was also impressed with this cocktail because there was sufficient alcohol content in it.  After a few sips, I definitely felt the alcohol!  I liked this because it meant that the restaurant did not cheap out on the ingredients.\n\nP had the Paloma Italiana, a cocktail with tequila reposado, Aperol, and grapefruit.  At the time, I think I liked it but it wasn't very memorable now when I'm writing about it.. lol.  (I do remember that it was just as strong as my cocktail meaning that again, they included sufficient alcohol into it -- you'll be surprised at how many restaurants cheap out on the alcohol in cocktails.)\n\nWe were served some bread with an olive spread which was so delicious and tasted like fresh olives!  Yummy.\n\nFor an antipasto to share, we had the Polenta Fries.  These were polenta fries served with roasted garlic aioli and a sundried tomato ketchup.   I'm a fan of polenta fries but I was really disappointed in this dish because of its portion size.  The presentation of it was unique -- the fries were served in a mini cart with paper.  However, since there were only seven or so polenta fries, it didn't look like there was very much of it at all.  The two dipping sauces were served in small squeezable plastic bottles.  I think to improve this dish, they should display it differently to emphasize the fries and not a couple of small fries in a large cart and plate.\n\nI have tasted better polenta fries before.  The polenta fries that I've had before were thick cut so that you could really taste the polenta in each one.  The polenta fries here were a little dry and over-salted. \n\nWe ordered the Mushroom and Spinach Garganelli pasta dish which contained roasted wild mushrooms and spinach with testun al barolo, parmegiano, and truffle oil.  This was a lovely pasta dish.  I especially liked the mushrooms and spinach!\n\nThe Margherita Pizza is a classic pizza to order.  It had mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, and tomato sauce.  Unfortunately, I thought that it's presentation wasn't impressive at all.  I expected the fior di latte to have melted in a more pronounced display on the pizza.  Instead, it looked just like a flat cheese pizza. \n\nTaste-wise, the Margherita Pizza was all right.  I liked the cheese in it.  I also expected there to have been more fresh basil leaves on it to look better (look at the photo of the Margherita Pizza on their website and you will see a big difference between the stock photo and this real life one).  Instead, the few pieces of basil on it were wilted due to the heat of the pizza.  Each bite of the pizza did have basil flavour though.\n\nWe ordered two desserts.  The Verona Chocolate Mousse had Grand Marnier and raspberry coulis.  The chocolate mousse was very soft and creamy.  The chocolate flavour was definitely evident.  It was a pretty dessert too.\n\nOne of the desserts that I remembered having from my first visit to Paese that stood out in my mind was the Affogato.  At the time, I remembered there was ice cream where you poured espresso on it and there was a huge delicious cookie (that B and I couldn't even finish because we had been so full that time).  I described it to P and she was curious about it and thus we ordered the Affogato on this visit.  It had white chocolate gelato, espresso, and a warm cherry and chocolate chip cookie.\n\nIt wasn't served in the same way as my first impression of it years ago where the chocolate chip cookie was placed on top of the mason jar that the ice cream came in but it looked close enough otherwise.  I didn't have any of the espresso (caffeine robs me of sleep) but I did try the white chocolate gelato and cookie.  Mmm, the white chocolate gelato was really good!!  The warm cherry and chocolate chip cookie was great too.\n\nI'm glad that I got to try the new PAESE again but I was disappointed that they simply serve Italian classics now and the creative dishes that I tried at their King Street PAESE years ago weren't available any longer.  Thus, to me PAESE is just like any other Italian restaurant -- their food was good but did come at a price.  The service was very professional.", "date": "2018-01-15 06:11:33"}, {"review_id": "ggrmYFhErYtVAJnmWL6Tzg", "user_id": "q6XnQNNOEgvZaeizUgHTSw", "business_id": "2cIOUvgj94isBx7-ssse8Q", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I had been ordering pizza and dining here since this location opened in the 70's.

The venue and lineups have been said to be really amazing so I decided to go with my friends.\n\nBecause it's fairly new, obviously EVERYONE and their mother wants to go. And because of this, it's pretty ridiculous just to get in.\n\nI went during the night when Calvin Harris was playing. My guy friends had to by tickets which were $75. That's pretty insane already. We showed up much later than we anticipated, around 10:30 or 11. The nice thing about our guy friends having tickets is that they got in within 20 minutes of waiting in line. But good luck finding the correct line. They'll have you going from one place to another. \n\nNow for the ladies. We talked to a promoter and they told us about the ladies line. We were trying to get there around 10ish to beat the crowd but we were driving to Vegas that same day and hit tons of traffic. Going any time after 11ish is a nightmare. NEVER in my life have I every waiting almost 2 hours in line. I'm happy that it was free, but their lines are not well organized. There were too many lines for too many different lists. And the lines basically became a cluster, people weren't sure which line they were in.\n\nSo by the time I did get in, it was waaaaaaaay too crowded. It was impossible to navigate! At this point, I just wanted to have fun. I didn't explore, but my friends went to the hip hop floor. Apparently there was a giant panda dancing with people. But they said the venue is really nice as a whole.\n\nNow I would have given Hakkasan a 2 had it not been for Calvin Harris. It was my first time seeing him but he is AMAZING! PLUS, Hakkasan's sound system and light show were top noch. They had dancers with weird Lady Gaga like outfits. Very cool. When I got into the music, it definitely helped me forget about the nightmare in line. \n\nI'm hoping that the lines and the craziness will go away when the hype begins to lesson but unless you're dying to see a specific performer, I would be sure to go fairly early or just go somewhere else.", "date": "2013-05-20 19:36:16"}, {"review_id": "R-22KdnEDrMYz2K--sXjBQ", "user_id": "Gfxb_D1k8tueAoGn4cseoA", "business_id": "3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 7, "funny": 5, "cool": 6, "text": "Over 900 reviews?

Front desk, room service, and valet were all top notch.\n\n-Location is great. Was here to see the Indians and A's. The hotel is about four blocks away from Progressive Field, and I didn't have any problems walking to/from the game (night game, too).\n\n-I highly recommend the valet. So much easier than self-parking. They were really busting their ass to help everyone, especially on Tuesday morning with all the morons who called to get their car, then didn't pick it up.\n\n-The bacon cheeseburger from room service was decent.\n\nCons:\n-Rooms were dated. I guess this hotel just had a major renovation, but it looks like they spent all their time on the common areas (which were nice). You could see dirt in the electrical outlets, and there were stains on the lamp shades and wallpaper. Looked like a little kid went nuts. TV was a decent flat screen, but the remote hardly worked.\n\n-Bed was so-so comfortable. Not the worst, and I was able to sleep OK, but I've had better. The alarm clock was BRIGHT, even on it's dimmest setting.\n\n-The A/C sucked. I like it somewhat warm, and when I first got in to the room I saw the A/C was set at 60, so of course I turned it up. Now it's at 70 and felt like 80. I see why it was turned down. Looked like the curtain was resting against the A/C air inlet, blocking the airflow. The unit was quiet, though.\n\n-The light by the door you turn on when you first get in to the room was very dim. I'd rather see a brighter fluorescent in that lamp so you can see inside.

I called lots of places on a Sunday morning, and this was the only place that could fit me in at the last minute.\n\nMy daughter was having some breakouts, and I thought a facial would serve her well.  I immediately became a member because I thought the $59 membership would \"force\" me to get out and do something for myself.  (Although I have not been a stay at home mom for 9 years, I am still accustomed to not spending much money on myself.)\n\nMy daughter's face cleared up quickly.  I followed up with some express facials, but eventually I signed her up for monthly facials as well because her skin only stayed clear with consistent facials.  I currently have both daughters (14 and 16) getting monthly facials.  \n\nThe place is clean and very welcoming.  I never had regular facials before coming to Fuchsia.  I had one facial at Dolce salon.  It was nice, but I thought the people were snotty.\n\nI later had a second facial and massage at JC Penny salon.  It was also nice.  However, when I went back for my second appointment, I waited for 20 minutes before leaving.\n\nSo mostly the facials I have had have been at Fuchsia.  From what I remember of the other places, Fuchsia's prices were much better and the quality was better as well.  \n\nNever once did I feel pressured to get memberships for my daughters.  Most of the ladies there do not pressure you to buy products either.  Some of the products are expensive, but Eminence products last a really long time and are worth it.  \n\nWe started to get pedicures at Fuchsia to last year after my daughter got an infection in her toe after getting a pedicure at a \"hole in the wall\" place.  The cost for pedicures is a little more at Fuchsia, but the infection on my daughter's foot taught me to not be so cheap in that area.\n\nFuchsia is a great place, and I am so happy with the service we've gotten.  They're flexible and are great when we have to make a change in appointments due to my daughter's busy school schedules.   \n\nMy girls still have some breakouts at times, but regular facials and extractions have really helped their skin and confidence with their appearance.\n\n**After being a member for quite some time, we finally cancelled last summer when we had problems scheduling.  Once the receptionist scheduled us on the day of a big event and when we showed up the day before for facials, manicures, and pedicures, she told me that we were scheduled for the following day.

We sat on their patio this past weekend and enjoyed a casual lunch before a stroll through Toronto's Summerhill neighbourhood.\n\nCrown and DragonThe Good: The small Yonge Street patio had the perfect amount of shade as we sat enjoying our Dragon Caesars ($7.25), an extra spicy cocktail mixed with their signature Dragon's Breath wing sauce. Their wings are half price after 5pm both Tuesday and Thursday nights, as well as all day on Sundays. We got a pound of their Smokin' Gun wings ($10.95 regular price), a sweet and smokey version of buffalo wing sauce, and they were cooked perfectly.\n\nThe spicy spinach dip ($9.95) wasn't too fiery, and tasted amazing with a side of chips and pita. We were stuck between deep fried pickles ($8.95) and jalape\u00f1o poppers ($6.99) but decided to go with the latter, which were very similar-if not the same-as the ones in the frozen section of the grocery store. But, I do love the grocery store kind and they were about the same price!\n\nThe Bad: The interior space of The Crown and Dragon is totally outdated. For this upscale area of Toronto it seems kind of run-down, but there's a sort of endearing homey charm to the atmosphere which almost functions as a sort of redeeming quality. The prices also seem a bit high considering the atmosphere.\n\nOverall: The Crown and Dragon is the sort of place that I will probably go back to have a beer with a friend in the summer, when the patio is open. The service was friendly and well-paced, it was an extremely laid back and casual atmosphere, and the drinks are just slightly cheaper compared with many similar venues in the area (take Spirits at Church and Bloor for instance). The food is pretty good and comparable to Jack Astor's, and the wings specials make it worth going back.\n\nThe Crowd: Around noon on a sunny Sunday, there were a handful of other people, mostly mid to late 20-somethings sitting outside with mid-day beers and caesars.\n\nSee their menu for pricing here.\n\n890 Yonge Street\n416-927-7976\n\nAnd don't forget to check out the Crown and Dragon Twitter account, they give away a $25 gift certificate once a month to one their followers!", "date": "2014-06-04 18:12:12"}, {"review_id": "q6p3IDGyC505ZtXWhtXEew", "user_id": "XNPwLVwHPyrOaEQA_sI1wg", "business_id": "3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This does not happen often that I completely disagree with the rating of the \"masses\" but I really struggled to see what's so great about this spot.

This doesn't usually bode well with me because, from my personal experience, the fancier the restaurant, the more they stray from the authenticity of the cuisine by trying to please the american palate.\nWe eschewed the nouvelle cuisine menu items obvious there to please that crowd and  ordered the Escovitch Fish and Jerk Chicken since my favourite \"ox-tail\" was nowhere on the menu and that is the dish most jamaicans use to test the excellence of our restaurants. I guess it doesn't ring well in a fancy place. Anyway, as a Kingstonian, I am used to going to a beach area where they cook up the best escovitch fish, corned with country pepper (habanero) and onions and dripping with grease but just finger licking good. That was not the case here but it was a darn righ better that I could have whipped up in my kitchen at home. I think most americans will probably enjoy it but I will wait until I am back home or at a greasy spoon in Brooklyn or one of the many Florida cities with large jamaican communities. The jerk chicken was also nothing like you would get back home but exotic enough for vacationers to the island needing a bit of nostalgia. The rice and peas was missing something.

The restaurant is divided into 3 floors, with the most bottom floor being the washroom, the 2nd floor the main dining spot, and top floor the private party room, which our party got to use because there were about 20 of us. \nThe private party room is really nice and since it's the only dining area on the top floor, you can enjoy a quiet meal without disturbance from the guests. However, I'm not sure if there is any elevator for those who have trouble climbing the stairs. \n\nFood: \nI got the Tuna Tartare for appetizer, Sushi Platter for main, and the Matcha Tiramisu for dessert. \nTuna Tartare tasted pretty good, I liked the miso/soya sauce that they used and it wasn't overly salty, but the portion was a lot smaller if you were to pay full price for the regular dish. \nSushi Platter contained 13 pieces of Nigiri Sushi, and they were made the traditional style with wasabi in between the rice and the fish. The fish tasted fresh, no watery/soggy texture, but not exactly enough for dinner. \nMatcha Tiramisu was also very small. It wasn't like your typical tiramisu in the sense contained no coffee liquor, and the cream was made with matcha flavour. I liked it, but I also wished that we had more of it. \n\nService:\nOur servers were professional at accommodating our big group and they got all our food correct. They mostly left us alone while we ate each course and would come by to pick up the dishes before the next course was served. \n\nOverall, I found that the food just wasn't enough for dinner, so we basically had to go grab some cheap eats after, which was unfortunate, considering $28 before tax and the 18% gratuity wasn't exactly cheap for dinner.", "date": "2017-08-01 19:03:11"}, {"review_id": "_hZ2n0X2Wk0vQLkSwyANtw", "user_id": "dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA", "business_id": "9uS0tzGl3Vw4WYVooQ73AQ", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "This is where I get all my prescriptions filled.

They do have a drive-thru which I've never used and I've always wondered if going though the drive-thru would be faster than going inside and waiting in line.\n\nI honestly don't buy any of my toiletry items from here as I think their prices are higher than Walmart.", "date": "2012-08-29 05:18:06"}, {"review_id": "FOMZkYSE7T2nS1y_tpm1qg", "user_id": "bFl0Cg7anF3yVN6dcX2Tbw", "business_id": "KwKkNTxYGyo4H6pKZ6usSA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The bookshelf pegs arrived a little over a week after the bookshelf did, and the deliveryman installed the shelves for me. Later, a team of two guys attached a mirror to my dresser that I originally wanted to keep separate, but later changed my mind. I'm not sure why they sent out two separate parties to complete two small tasks on the same day, but whatever, it got done. It was a little confusing because one party called me to confirm a time and the other party called my dad, although I had been scheduling and accepting all deliveries. Not a problem, though.\n\nAfter everything was settled, I received a handwritten thank-you note in the mail from one of the two salespeople we worked with.

I was around the neighborhood running errands and decided to check this place out since I live on the other side of the town.  \n\nIt was literally 112 outside and thank god there was no line.  I tried the beef, tofu and egg tacos and also ordered their \"not so fries\".  I gota say one thing, they are definitely different tacos.  I couldn't get a strong grasp on whether I truly liked them or not.  The Korean type slaw they threw on top of the tacos were a bit sweet and had a strange taste to it.  The tortillas like everyone else said were flour and not as hot and soft as they should be.  The fries were tasty but also a bit on the salty side.  \n\nOverall, its a cool place to try out but I probably wont be coming back here for a while since it didn't blow my mind.  I was probably too excited on the idea and then the food let me down a bit.", "date": "2010-07-25 09:44:02"}, {"review_id": "KjRjE75GBU_a1THxngjIww", "user_id": "Erw46-4d-QIzmj1ULQE0YA", "business_id": "T-1A_7-XHCv8XDXaMIlefA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Food here is overall decent and fast.
