I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \n\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \n\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \n\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!", "date": "2017-01-14 21:30:33"}, {"review_id": "2TzJjDVDEuAW6MR5Vuc1ug", "user_id": "n6-Gk65cPZL6Uz8qRm3NYw", "business_id": "WTqjgwHlXbSFevF32_DJVw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I have to say that this office really has it together, they are so organized and friendly!

Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn't stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won't be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly.", "date": "2018-01-30 23:07:38"}, {"review_id": "fdiNeiN_hoCxCMy2wTRW9g", "user_id": "w31MKYsNFMrjhWxxAb5wIw", "business_id": "eU_713ec6fTGNO4BegRaww", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta.

What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.\n\nI'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a \"C\" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. \n\nMmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. \n\nThe jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. \n\nThey provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. \n\nNot gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside.

This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.\n\nSo at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....\n\nWe were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.\nThat's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.\n\nSo we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.\n\nIn summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else.

She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that! \n\nUgh, I don't care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!

However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.\n\nOk onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries.

There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well.

Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave.

Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.\n\nToo bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. \n\nThe playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! \n\nAfter a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the \"nice stuff\" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, \"Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?\" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.\n\nAfter carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff. \n\nSo, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime.

Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.\n\nI expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. \n\nTo top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing.

We, my boyfriend and I,  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.  \n\nSo we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how \"hot\" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable \"romantic\" evening of my life...\n\nNow to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a \"salad\", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.\n\n\nThe soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.\n\nThe appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!\n\nThe salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.\n\nThe meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.\n\nThe dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?\n\nThe wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...\n\nThe atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.\n\nWe finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! \n\nUpon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.\n\nWould I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.\n\nAnd to the lady we sat next to...Good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth.", "date": "2011-02-13 16:59:31"}, {"review_id": "_LPOtmfWnL_8_tL3ImhoLw", "user_id": "91DAiIKXri-41uzYue2hlg", "business_id": "w6F502EKMyn3ONbGT2bQxw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point.

Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said \"No\" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.\nThe worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in. We live 3 1/2 hours from Mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service, this was definitely not a pleasant experience", "date": "2018-03-15 20:12:39"}, {"review_id": "EedJ77WTwkytYhAR-PVMKQ", "user_id": "piYjHlLZQCtg9Q1QT0Lvbw", "business_id": "gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Five stars!

It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).\n\nHowever, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.\n\nIn general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend.

(You are old like me if you know that theme song!)\n\nHave you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.\n\nSome call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.\n\nReservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!\n\nBeing in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  \n\nSo if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  \n\nThe food:\n\nComplimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.\n\nCaesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.\n\nBread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  \n\nSpaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  \n\nLinguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.\n\nTiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.\n\nLemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.\n\nLadies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!\n\nTL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.

The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.\n\nThe enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were saut\u00e9ed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.\n\nWarning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy.

The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong.

The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \n\nLast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\n\nI paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \n\nWhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. \n\nI walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I'll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \n\nI honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\n\nI realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.", "date": "2014-01-17 03:27:38"}, {"review_id": "Y978JzDt7gcS0BaBTnd0NA", "user_id": "wsP41YZKPPvM7HQcUufz2w", "business_id": "WcM95CvBQCokDVM1M9rBWA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Just found out about this secret treasure!

Let me explain...\n\nThere are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. \n\nFOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \n\nI'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \n\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \n\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \n\nI won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.\n\nService: 4 stars\n\nKitch: 4 stars\n\nFood: 1 star", "date": "2013-06-24 06:42:29"}, {"review_id": "O4074JMW-wXUL4lsCWM2JA", "user_id": "zAxCqpH6zknQSRceUMuUfQ", "business_id": "w2xwgqHM7dJlHfyu4ouhBg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Azzip Pizza is literally SO good.

The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.\n\nI am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.\n\nCOBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!\n\nNow the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex\n\nI first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.\n\nI then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.\n\nI then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\n\nWhen I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.\n\nFinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\n\nI went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\n\nThe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \n\nI knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\n\nI suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.\n\nAs a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\n\nI went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \n\nThey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\n\nJared to the rescue:\n\nI took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\n\nLesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!\n\nCOBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF.

Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.\n\nThere're a few reasons I don't like it there:\n1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine/samples/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.\n\n2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.\n\n3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. \n\nI normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody.", "date": "2011-11-29 23:16:37"}, {"review_id": "a_g4eysuYC1pI9tv3MCZxA", "user_id": "QaN-nccbLZPWzownQYgTVQ", "business_id": "LzWROAt-RhgaBss4cOoDRQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 11, "funny": 3, "cool": 4, "text": "I love the West Side Market but I can't stand the crowds, the parking, and the general gentrified douchery that seems to accompany the entire process.

I don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood, but I'd like to shake their hand. It's just what the doctor ordered.\n\nImagine, if you will, a bright, airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region, rows of farm fresh eggs, coolers filled with Amish chicken and local ground beef...yeah, right. No, really, it's true. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but for an area of Cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air. It does what Cleveland and the rest of the nation needs, it encourages consumption of fresh, local foods. So what do they have to offer?\n\n-Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables with everything from plump bing cherries to more exotic fare like chayote and California avocados. \n\n-A bakery with Cleveland favorites like kugel and kolaczki and a deli stocked to overflowing with meats and cheeses from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\n-A bulk section with plenty of flour, rice, pie fillings, nuts, seeds, and other goodies.\n\n-Giant bags of peanuts, onions, apples, and carrots.\n\n-A wall of bulk candy packaged in little containers perfect for hiding in your cupboard behind the quinoa and flax seeds.\n\n-Reasonable prices. It's not as cheap as fast food, no. But if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health.\n\nI could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but I want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit. I know, it's not the West Side Market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway.

I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.\n\nWe walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  \n\nMy family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  \n\nIn the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.", "date": "2015-05-26 07:46:21"}, {"review_id": "snHJ1r0lIChCdTvtUHHKhA", "user_id": "7Gl4ah_uRVmXPro_J2PFRg", "business_id": "nZAJ2a2-Oyxt6GzX97i2pg", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food .

If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. \n\nOne really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. \n\nDefinitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.", "date": "2013-10-03 08:38:38"}, {"review_id": "XqFb2c5I4l8Q5SmQ30datA", "user_id": "MXwWj1pbG29aC3tFdyo7XA", "business_id": "R1jJQi2yR44D_2ileqr8kA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it!

These guys only care about your money and nothing more. When I joined I later had to cancel with them because I had to meet with my National Guard unit and I didn't know what kind of schedule I'd have. They seemed understanding and said it wasn't a problem. At this time I would have rated this gym very good, because I had fun with no issues. I even told them I'd probably start back up here after I know what schedule looked like. So I stop going after my month expired because I cancelled(even on my attendance sheet it said it was my last and only month.) I later check my bank statement and they charged me again, okay no big deal probably a mistake. I call them, no answer. Okay that's fine I'll email them explaining the mistake. I'll give them a few days to get back to me max. Hear nothing from them. Call them again, no answer. Call them again they finally answered. I explain the situation with guy that answers and he says \"Oh yeah i got your email but I forgot to call you.\". At this point I'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service. Then after that he tells me no I haven't cancelled and I'm going to have to pay another two months worth. He tells me I must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken English so he must have misunderstood me when I cancelled with him a month prior to this). He won't help me out at all, just says I have to pay more. Thank god I have Navy Federal for a bank because I call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me. They repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym, they also put a stop payment on the gym. Well sure and behold I get charged by them AGAIN and I call my bank asking why did this happen? Turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment. I ask what I can do. They say to email them so I have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie.

They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke.

So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table, which gave a much better view.\n\nThe show was def entertaining, with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome, something about a man in a g-string is just wrong, you know? but nonetheless, it was very entertaining. The emcee's accent was hot, and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate, and some of the older women too, which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well, so no matter where your seats were, I think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys.\n\nDownside though, at the end of the show, you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys, only to receive one picture. no offense, but that is a total rip off. i've been to Fantasy, which is a female stripshow,  and you can take pics with them for free, and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show, and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf?

I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help. \n\nSwamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again.

If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.\n\nIn most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.\n\nThe interiors and d\u00e9cor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.\n\nHats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet.", "date": "2015-07-03 20:26:12"}, {"review_id": "0y6G9k9mgwORZ0oK4hTEHg", "user_id": "1IhQLnq__TWCaMgDgoihJQ", "business_id": "M8a5DRdXl8KMu4bMFLPgQg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I have been going to this nail salon for 8 months now.

When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, \" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy\".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.

Definitely a hidden gem in the GTA. But please be very very careful and get everything in writing. George Christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of Crystal Fountain is very devious and sketchy. \n\nWe had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.\n\nFast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.\n\nWe called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as \"assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres\" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.\n\nWhen we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. \n\nNeedless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.\n\nPlease be very wary of this George, he is very unscrupulous.

For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \"butter\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!\nThe end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate.

Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.\n\nFor an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.\n\nI really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent.

When I walked in the store, I didn't know who the owner was, until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I'm not going to buy a large cake.

In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze.

The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.\n\nI also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. \n\nThey brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate.

It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)\n\nThere was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.\n\nOK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.

Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.\n\nI've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.\n\nI've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  \n\nOf the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   \n\nThe only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.\n\nI have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?\n\nBut alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.

I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service.

We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\" x 12\" square and 10-12\" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\" square base, next layer 6\" base and the top layer 4\" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2\" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake.

I even talked to a supervisor who was the worst \"supervisor\" I've ever dealt with. Two hours later and I now have to wait until Thursday. Nobody apologized, nobody seemed to care. I told them if they don't come Thursday I'll be cancelling my service and going with Cox. Also, this whole time I was on their site talking with a live customer service rep online trying to figure this out, but all they told me was they couldn't do anything. So today's Worst Company Award goes to Centurylink.", "date": "2017-07-18 17:47:09"}, {"review_id": "t57thGdsF0of7iFM7R2crQ", "user_id": "WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g", "business_id": "WP0M2cpWzhsMwk7kPtreRA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "It was a lonely cold evening and the roads were slick from the rain that was pouring down...\n\nNOT! \n\nActually to tell you the truth it was a bright, hot & sunny day [like usual in Vegas] and my great aunt and uncle were visiting.

Mexican food sounded good..\n\nHey, look its Viva Mercados!\n\n[my aunt] so you've been there?!\n\n[me] No.. but lets try it.\n\nWalking in the decor was the usual.. whats the word.. oh yes.. Festive. But then again thats what you find at every mexican restaurant.\n\nThe hostess sat us quickly. 1 star for that. lets just state.. I HATE WAITING. especially if the place isn't busy. \n\nQuick, friendly service. Lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before. Add, 1 more star.\n\nDidn't try the chips, salsa or bean dip. I'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food. No, i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience. [yes, i know im just brilliant, no need for the pat on the back]\n\nThe food came and it was hot. It was delicious, mostly cause i was starving.. but it wasn't something that was spectacular. My mother in law makes better beans and rice. The taco cracked as soon as i took a bite. Thats another pet peeve. Inside I cried a little.. Now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out. Well, that ruined my taco experience. Boo. The chile relleno was delish. Cooked to perfections and de-seeded, just the way I like it. Adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno. Overall it was good\n\nWould have given it another star but this place is way over priced.

The woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions. They have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. Very reasonably priced menu! I got the tuna melt, it was just ok. The tuna salad was a bit too over dressed for my liking. It felt gluttonous with all the mayonnaise and I think there was mustard in there maybe? It came with a side and I chose coleslaw, it felt kind of like the kind you would buy in a big jar at sam's club, not my favorite but others like their sides so maybe I'll try something else next time. The others liked the chips and the macaroni salad. Chicken salad on the croissant had similar opinions on the tuna that it was thick and over dressed but the croissant was toasted and good.\n\nI would definitely check this place out again, maybe for breakfast next time!

I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.\nAtmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. \nService: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.\nFood (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.\nFood (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this \"ironic\"; I say, \"tacky!\" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting \"Go back to Denny's\", I'm talking value, not price.

And the menu looked... okay.\n\nBut I'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out, so why not?\n\nWelp, it wasn't good my friend. \n\nI ordered the Packhouse burger; because, if you can't do a burger right, then something is seriously wrong. And it was ALL wrong. Not once but twice.\n\nMy other homie decides to get the same thing. She didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well. I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far? \n\nWe both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway, they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it, they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger. \n\nThey were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!\n\nNew Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard. \n\nThe Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.\n\nMy other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well. \n\nAlso we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point. \n\nThe desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good. \n\nThe oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it! \n\nSo there you have it. \n\nThe service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work. \n\nThe location and setup is dope.

I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. \n\nWe had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) \n- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) \n- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)\n- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  \n- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. \n- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \n- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \n- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \n- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  \n\n***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol \n\nOVERALL RATINGS:\nFood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\nFood (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! \nDrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio\nPresentation - 4 stars\nService & Ambiance - 4 stars\n\nI gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.

The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. \n\nOkay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. \n\nStarted with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.\n\nBeef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.\n\nThe Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. \n\nThe Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. \n\nDesserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!\n\nThis was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!", "date": "2009-10-13 03:33:06"}, {"review_id": "cSkzuxDxW87T5ojzedITaA", "user_id": "gywt65MT0_XY_kuV2eHUxg", "business_id": "0ZplgTLfGZvIKkG63ohfog", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 10, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I have purchased two carpets here and went for my third today.

I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.

The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?\n\nThere are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  \n\nThe second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  \n\nBoth of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  \n\nAfter all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  \n\nThen, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  \n\nWe head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  \n\nWe start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a \"slider\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.\n\nWhen the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.\n\nSo, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.\n\nThe kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  \n\nOK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   \n\nAgain, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.", "date": "2015-01-03 21:34:24"}, {"review_id": "ItrR6yWNED-Ru_UOJdyvVQ", "user_id": "bt_ZB8UvrfB33CbdMPAAZA", "business_id": "GEvolb_U74NXgfgdxrVtyQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I tried Nichiban for the first time, and I definitely have to agree with the reviews from the other users for this restaurant.

Being a big fan of salmon sashimi, I asked if the sashimi bento and other main courses containing sashimi, can be replaced with all salmon sashimi and yes, it can be done.  I had the salmon sashimi bento box accordingly, and I have nothing but praise for the quality of the sashimi and the taste of the tempura, spicy salmon sushi and even the salad that accompanied the bento.  \n\nThey even gave us a huge plate of grilled salmon pieces, all on the house - also quite yummy!

The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices.

My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes, but everything else just...normal. \n\nHonestly, the best part about this place, in my opinion, is that it takes brunch reservations.

We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  We politely ask if we could move to the front.  The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .  \nWe were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  It is a sweet butter with orange zest.  \nWe were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side.   The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). \nI was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all.  \nOn the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good! \n Our server disappeared  while we were eating our meal.

It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.\n\nSince the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.\n\nThe fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever.

My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.

I'm only giving them one star because I can't post otherwise, but they're not even worth that. I used MovingAPT.com to find them - won't ever use them again either. I thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening. I don't even know where to start with my complaints; this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism. I paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano. \n\nWhen they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano. My dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. This is a stage piano, the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! After loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (Virginia), my stuff is taken from Wyoming to Seattle, then back to Vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. I only found out because I kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so I could plan accordingly. After repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey East. \n\nFinally, they call to tell me they'll be there on June xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window I said I would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered BEFORE the contract was even signed. So I'm told if I can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they'd go on to New York with my stuff and I'd have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). After they had unloaded everything and AFTER I had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don't have anything to move the piano. So they decide they'll go to Home Depot, hire random men, and carry/lift the piano into my house. You don't LIFT a piano! So my friend that's there says no, it's too heavy, you need the proper equipment, I suggest you go find it. So then they tell him that they need to get on the road to New York for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until I was back so I'd let them deliver it. Again, they're told no, at which point the driver calls me while I'm in the airport and says if I don't let them into my house I'd have to pay a second delivery fee. I told them not to leave the state with my piano and I'd call them right back - so I call my friend and ask what's going on; he gives me the scoop. I asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til I could get a professional. He said OK, and while I'm still on the phone, I hear him say exactly that to the driver. I call the driver back myself and say the same thing. I literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said OK. My friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, ROLLED it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, DROPPED it, eventually go it inside, and we're RUNNING TO THEIR TRUCK when my friend gets back. They hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. He had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped.

Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.  \n\nThat being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.\n\nGreeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as \"XL\".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.  \n\nNice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!\n\nTROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.\n\nDrinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!\n\nEntrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.\n\nI'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!\n\nWas my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.\n\nHuge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!\n\nBonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!\n\nSo at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had \"hid\" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.

He said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery. He suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain. Then the next appointment with Dr Lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain, my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard. Shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain. Then she was prescribed with pain meds. This went on another few years. She was crying in pain everyday and in the night too. I massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution I could find besides taking the pain meds. She cried and  \"begged\" me to cut off her arm several times. We finally went back to Lederman again. This time my daughter refused to take no for an answer...she wanted the surgery. Dr Lederman left the room and came back in saying \"I'm not the man for job. Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI.\" Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one. My daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it. He did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart.

Getting to the club was simple, took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)! \n\nEntry: Got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1:1 (guy/girl) comp until midnight. Sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on. The entry line was confusing as hell, with at least 4 different lines (staff, promoter, general, VIP). There was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed. This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn't. Whatever, lesson learned. Don't rush in. Don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you're approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don't listen to otherwise!\n\nClub Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It's beautiful.\n\nBar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you'll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5.", "date": "2012-12-04 07:49:34"}, {"review_id": "pSU8m0PNKlw-JMOEr6bmqA", "user_id": "ruduqSWpb84v2VCXJKrOPA", "business_id": "Wxxvi3LZbHNIDwJ-ZimtnA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This is a grand place in many ways; the lobby is pretty, the d\u00e9cor is over-the-top Disneyland, the shops are great, the choice of restaurants (which skew towards heavy foods) is good, and the rooms are big and comfortable.

The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their \"Socialite\" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their \"lycheetini\".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have. \n\nWhen it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called \"hana awaka\"....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new! \n\nThe food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.  \n\nEveryone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.   \n\nThe ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation. \n\nOverall, we had an incredible experience dining at social house.

Typically I had to go to Oakland to get all this done and I wanted to see if I could find somewhere closer to home. I got new glasses, lenses and a new hard lens here.\n\nFirst they lost the order for my eyeglasses. They never realized this until about a month after my visit and I called having not heard anything. When I got them the prescription was far too strong and they had to back it off. So getting my glasses took over two months.\n\nFor my hard lens it took time to get that correct as well, but that is expected. It also took me several times asking my Oakland optometrist to get my records faxed to them. McCauley-Celin at first said they never received them, but they then found them in another computer system. When the first lens didn't fit quite right I went to the Wexford office to get it checked and left my lens there as it needed to be returned. When my new lens came they asked for my old one and apparently it was lost out there or somewhere. I paid for my lens with my FSA account but then was told that it should be covered under my insurance and that they would take care of it. That didn't happen so I called to ask about it. They never got back to me so I went to their Gibsonia office and they said that they owed me money and it was fixed.

About an hour later the doorbell rang and it was the plumber.  Luckily we were home as we never got a call.\n\nThe plumber was friendly and got right to work.  He was able to take care of one problem, but needed a part for the second one.  It turned out that he could not order the part (??) and we had to do it ourselves.  Once the part arrived about a week and a half later, the plumber came back out to finish the work.\n\nHe did a decent job and was a nice guy.  But, they were extremely expensive.

Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. \n\nAs more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. \n\nWe got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said \"this happens all the time.\" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). \n\nAlexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. \n\nThank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables. They are the best, they will always be the best. \n\nThanks again! :-)", "date": "2017-07-18 18:49:04"}, {"review_id": "Mto7puzyNVgNKQFrv8UVIQ", "user_id": "wAYR3oO-JM8yVVTMw23QgQ", "business_id": "O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "text": "The gelato here is sent from the gods themselves. \n\nJust kidding.

Items are always stocked well, regardless of when in the week you come. I am not the biggest fan of their produce however. About 20% of the time, I bring how green beans or asparagus, and two days later they are covered in mold (and no, it is not my refrigerator). So I no longer purchase produce here except for when I am in a bind.

They don't always have enough baggers, but last time I was there they had plenty, and wouldn't even let me unload my cart (they had a separate person in the aisle that unloaded people's carts for them). First time I've experienced that and it was pretty great. \n\nPrices are a bit on the high side overall, I would not shop here if you do not use your Smith's card. The prices are outrageous with out it. However, they end up being pretty reasonable when you remember to use the gas points (which is now made easier by the Smith's gas station located directly in front of this store). \n\nThey DEFINITELY need way more cart corrals in the parking lot.

Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.\n\nYou'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.\n\nFor my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.\n\nSo there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.

We had talked for a while about joining a gym, but fitness together is so much more. It's like a community of people working toward a common goal of getting fit and taking control of their health. The owner, Joe, is very knowledgeable in fitness, exercise, and most importantly nutrition. He worked with us to set up individual  nutrition plans and exercise programs to help us attain our goals. Included with your sessions purchase is a fitness assessment which measures body fat percentage, fitness levels, resting heart rate, flexibility, and a few other factors. Additional assessments are given throughout your tenure as a fitness together member so you can watch your total body transformation. It is a very encouraging atmosphere no matter your current level of fitness. At first I dreaded going to exercise, but after seeing the positive changes you just can't wait to get back. I like the fact that sessions can be purchased in packages without a long term commitment, but I must say I continue to add additional sessions. This is mainly because I continue to see results.

The one thing I we all really like about the drinks was that they were not too sweet.  \n\nWe ordered two apps for the table - Lobster Fritters and Braised beef short rib poutine.  OMG the poutine was out of this world!!  The fritters were good but there was no lobster flavor.  I think next time I would just order the vegetable fritters.\n\nFor mains we had fried fish tacos, steak burrito, jambalaya and grilled pork chop with red potato salad.  The jambalaya and the pork chop were features. The burritos was very nice.  The steak was a nice medium rare and it came with guacamole and lime crema.  Fish Tacos were delish!  The corn tortillas really make a difference.  The pork chop feature was really good.  My friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect.

The beignets were tougher than I expected but still good.\n\nI would like to point something out about this place.  No the food isn't cheap but the quality of the ingredients justifies the cost.

I had heard many great things about their food and service, so I had to check it out.  I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must've answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say \"hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!\" Much more personal.\n\nAnyhow, on to the food!!\n\nWe started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.\n\nMain Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.\n\nWe had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the \"canon\" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called \"bubble and squeak.\" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.\n\nFor dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.

Both times big let down. I order through Postmates several times a week and rarely ever have any issues so I know it's nothing they could of prevented unless the drivers start sampling the food and drinks before delivery. I ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold, doughy and undercooked. It was generously stuffed, almost too much. Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty.\nIced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing.\nChocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined. \nDear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful.

I chose them over several other companies because they are honest, hard-working individuals who operate their business with integrity and professionalism.  They manage my property so well I never have to worry about the details.  And as an out-of-state property owner, I don't want to worry and have extra hassles!  They take care of everything, every step of the way.  Their communications are clear, concise, timely, and professional.  I will never switch and go to another company because I am so convinced I am getting honest and impeccable service from Active Renter, at a very reasonable cost.\n\nAs for the tenants who are complaining, I am hard-pressed to believe that Rich and the entire Active Renter crew have treated anyone poorly or have not serviced rentals in a timely manner. There are also people who tear up property (not their property!!) and then complain when they get billed for all the damages.  These are probably the same tenants who punch holes in dry wall, steal furnaces (who DOES that!?!?!?!), damage landscaping, tear up concrete driveways, etc.  - and then later complain when they are held accountable for the damages they created.  It's said that people who have negative comments are much more likely to post a review than people with positive comments - on a 9 to 1 basis!  So for every complaint, remember there are dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands of individuals who have wonderfully positive things to say about Active Renter, but just don't take the time to post a review.\n\nFrom either the property management or the leasing side, I don't think you'll get better service anywhere than Active Renter provides.  I would recommend them - WITHOUT RESERVATION - to any family member, friend, and/or colleague.  They are the best in the business and their high rate of growth is proof positive they are the best property management company around.  You can't go wrong with Active Renter.  They are the real deal.\n\nIf I could give them 10 stars, I would!  They are that awesome!\n\nP. S.

I've never seen any member nor staff clean the equipment so make sure you wipe down before your set. They do have staff clean the facility, empty trash, fix broken equipment which is the way it should be. \n\nThe Gym gets very crowded at times, I think the local football team got a discount to workout there lol.

It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.\n\nI ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.\n\nOn another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how \"When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion.\" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.\n\nI've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience.

The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of \"I'm sorry!\"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater.

After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week. \n\nI agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more. \n\n- A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood. \n\n- A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here. \n\n- There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike. \n\n   It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not. \n\n- There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.\n\n- There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) ) \n\n- There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city. \n\n- At the top, there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city. \n\n- Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch. \n\n- There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months. \n\n- Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning. \n\n- Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well. \n\n*** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park.", "date": "2016-01-17 06:00:36"}, {"review_id": "b05JK0eKmONKMaR4ZLNSuw", "user_id": "tdxR42PJOMwI4GQEbrvrsw", "business_id": "mz9ltimeAIy2c2qf5ctljw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 3, "cool": 2, "text": "If you are looking for Chinese acrobats as in other Cirque du Solei shows, don't go to this show.

In fact, he kept cutting Nate off & saying \" So it's okay\". Naturally, Nate was irritated & said \" NO! I can't eat this\" & Mike still didn't get it & kept talking over him. Then he walked away...he never apologized nor offered to get Nate something else to eat. He didn't remove the cost from our bill, nothing! When Nate complained to our server he didn't understand either so the nasty sandwich sat there. Our server also saw that my pasta was left untouched but never asked if something was wrong. I get this kid was clearly new to the food service industry but seriously -WTF!?!  \n My husband had also ordered a drink from the bar when we first sat down, it took our server over 15 minutes to grab it from the bar. Nate had requested a rootbeer, not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! Normally I wouldn't suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints, the food wasn't even edible & our patience was gone; I was tempted to leave without paying. \n Finally, a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove Nates sandwich from our receipt. However, she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1. She then explained that all of their staff quit @ the same time & all the new hires are \"green\". This is still unacceptable & I don't feel that anyone there is competent.

I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems.\nThe drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails.\nOne of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles. \nI am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn't that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry.\nAnother rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn't very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.\n\nI think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.\n\nAnother weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.

When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.\n\nOur server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.\n\nOverall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent.", "date": "2017-11-06 16:38:23"}, {"review_id": "TwqYusLCF4Hw0-ljK7jkNg", "user_id": "bU7j91DrMZCDrhPUrd_AWg", "business_id": "dftvaoP-Rz1u-eQNYgXqvA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Was absolutely starving we passed this place and decided to give it a try.

Unfortunately, \"The Buffet\" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.\n\nFirst, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nI hope this buffet gets their act together soon.

In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly.", "date": "2013-09-04 00:22:15"}, {"review_id": "vxsyCM7tsBIf1pAYH1Erlw", "user_id": "WJYs12ng86_q70n4CkdkTA", "business_id": "ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I had lunch at the buffet and it was by far the best buffet I've had in Vegas to date (I've travelled here quite often).

It was the midafternoon, so the atmosphere was subdued. Some may refer to this place as a \"hole in the wall,\" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away. During our visit, the green-colored d\u00e9cor included a large mural, blue-checkered floors, TVs, and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area.\n\nSanti and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12.95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice, spices, lettuce, yam, red onions, and Peruvian corn. The tilapia was fresh, nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering. The spices were nicely embedded, and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce. The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too. At first I was concerned about the portion size, but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile. \n\nWe then shared Pollo Saltado ($11.95) made with chunks of chicken saut\u00e9ed with chopped tomatoes, french fries, red onions, cilantro, mignonette and soy sauce, and a side of steamed rice. The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken. The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish. The fries were tasty, fried to perfection, and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors. I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes. It met my expectations.\n\nThe Seco de Res ($13.95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce, green peas, and served with fried yucca, salsa criolla, and Peruano beans. The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices. It was nicely stewed, tender, but also had lots of dry spots. The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish. The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins. We both loved the Peruano beans. It was nicely cooked down, subtly sweet, and flavorful. \n\nWe were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce. The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants. \n\nThe flavors were far-reaching, but there were a number of limitations worth noting. First, unlike most Peruvian restaurants, Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal. Secondly, service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal. But, for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table, an act I find unusual, offensive, and disrespectful. Ironically, we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened.\n\nThe server did however, give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food. Given the nice gesture, I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt, but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience.\n\nInterested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table.

Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.\n\nI get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)\n\nSo here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:\n\nThere is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???\n\nThe lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.\n\nIf you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.\n\nLock box is available for $20 by the entrance.\n\nNot going back.", "date": "2012-06-26 00:31:08"}, {"review_id": "rFEYYeOzCxxrNgKcXZg1ew", "user_id": "4W1YPImVuHf4gg_9qbmKig", "business_id": "bpxGzNiVA_OhUvmdaDzbMQ", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Buyer beware!!!

Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.\n\nThis NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.\n\nI love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.\n\nSonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.\n\nWe started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.\n\nFor the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.\n\nMy husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.\n\nThere were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.\n\nWe were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.\n\nAll in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.

Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.  \n\nNothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.   \n\nI was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. \n\nServers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  \n\nI do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  \n\nThe atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK.

Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.\n\nWe also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.\n\nFor our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. \n\nWe ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.\n\nEarlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.

First one was a year ago, when I requested the parts fellow to order me a new muffler. He said it would be in, in about 3 days. 5 days later I called, and he forgot to order it. 10 days later, I called them again, and they still forgot to order it, despite me being in front of the counter. \nSecond situation was on Nov. 4 th, 2017. My 1998 Rav 4 was not carrying a charge despite me purchasing a new battery, the evening before. On that cold and snowy day, my wife and I broke down on 130th Ave S.E. . I managed to get the vehicle as far as the Safeway Parking lot, where we were stranded. I called the Canadian tire across the street and spoke to the manager. He told me to bring it right in. Well, we called a tow truck and waited for 2 and a half hours. No biggy there as it was a busy day for them as one could imagine. We brought the vehicle in on a large flat bead truck. I asked the mechanic, where did he want it; and he said anywhere. Once we dropped it; I went inside and spoke to Ron about the problems. Ron was a super nice guy. Very friendly. I mentioned to him, that there was a loose + positive cable clamp that had to be tightened. I needed to have the alternator checked as the new battery died on us . \"After the repairs are completed Ron, could you please have them do a safety check on the vehicle please?\" Here came the upsell. \" Well, he said, we have 3 different types of safety checks. Then he felt a pressing need to tell me all about them and their respective prices. I cut him off short, and instructed him to provide me with the cheapest (100.00) safety check. \nHere in point form, were the blunders that were committed. \n1. Ron got my name wrong, my sex wrong, and all this with me standing in front of him and correcting him as he put an entirely different name on the key tag. I corrected him and even called back to ensure that the information on the work order was complete; but he didn't even bother to put down the much needed information. That's just plain unprofessional. \n2. I spoke to him about purchasing a new battery, just the night before, and that my + cable clamp was not tight. Despite this, he didn't bother to put any of this on the work order. \n3. Never informed me of the labor costs, part costs if it was a alternator and so forth\n4.Never mentioned on the work order that the vehicle died while driving; but instead, said that it just stalled. \n5. The assistant manager \" Dennis\" called and left a message for me, that the Rav would not pass a safety test because that battery is not working, and a headlight bulb was out. (Well of course....why do you think it was there?) \n6. The assistant manager called me a second time at my residence later the next day; and informed me that my alternator would need replacing despite it being purchased new from one year previous. I asked him how much the alternator was and he gave me a rough cost. Then he said I would be charged. 1.2 ( which I guess was one hour and twenty minutes) for the labour. Fair enough I said, go ahead with the repair. At this point I figured;, it will be about 5 hundred dollars by the time they soak me for everything. \n7. Later that day I picked up the vehicle and it was way over and above at $683.00. When asked to explain the costs...they said they were too busy. \n8. When I arrived home, I looked at the invoice and noticed that they hadn't even taken the time to fill out the top of the safety check. Truth be known, they never probably checked a thing. No name, no policy number, no make model or year of the vehicle, no Vin number, no date...absolutely nothing!\n9. Shop supplies was 35 dollars and some change. There are only two bolts that secure an alternator to it's bracket. Tell me where were there 35 worth there? \n10. The assistant manager couldn't provide me ( their customer) with the proper warrantee period for it, nor did he know how long safety checks are good for. \n** Now after all that, does this sound like a professional service to you? They should be ashamed for treating customer's this way. \nNeedless to say; I won't be back for any service.

If you can make it to dessert then get their churros. They are bomb! Oh and they have a nice little salsa bar with a variety of different salsa and sauces. If you get a soda with your meal then you can get free refills (which is unheard of for a casino!).\n\nBesides burritos they also have street tacos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas.

I was not rude just direct. I am a manager in one of the largest corporations so I know all about tone and customer service. Before I could call Paramount they called me. She did not let me speak or explain the issue before she advised me that I was rude and had no right to speak to the vendor that way.

She said because I was a liar and she believed them since she had worked with them before. She continued to speak to me like I was not a paying tenant and yell at me like I was causing the issue. I had to remind her it is Paramounts legal obligation to provide water and hot water since I am the tenant. She said she was going to cancel my work order since I was rude and had issues. I am sorry but no matter how rude (which I wasn't) it is the property managements responsibility to make sure this is fixed. This was 3 days now with no hot water.

She made it sound like I was the one who was irrational and upset but of course my husband believed me not her. She was speaking nicely to him until he advised her that he was my husband and he did not appreciate how she spoke to me. She then reverted back to her old self and had an attitude. He advised her that this is not how things work and it is their legal obligation to make sure this gets taken care of in a timely manner. He also stated he was an Army veteran and he gave her respect so she needed to give him respect and return.

Not the biggest game selection I've seen, but still great. Also have foosball. \n\nBeer selection is decent, even though a few taps were out when we were there. A lot of local offerings. I LOVE the bar is made out of old cassette tapes! We tried the nacho pretzel, and it was a bit of a let down. Needed more salt, more flavor. I'm sure this will all get better as things go.\n\nOverall, I am so pumped to have this place in South End! It is a great break from the usual and a great place to hang out any day of the week. We will be back!

What surprised me is that rarely have I seen anyone else eating there. Either I'm there at the wrong times or others have made the same assumption I did. I had miso soup a couple of times while they prepared the sushi, and it is just the right blend of ingredients. I'm a snob when it comes to miso so impressing me with that is a big deal.\n\nAs for the star, the sushi, it is made fresh with care and it shows. The $3 happy hour rolls are delicious, and the specialty rolls are even better. The Parma rolls in particular have become my all-time favorite, despite the fact that it is not so much sushi as it is crab on a ball of rice.\n\nAfter eating here, having sushi at the buffets and other restaurants in the area just isn't the same.  It's a must try if you are in the area, especially on Tuesday or Wednesday since one can easily fill up on two of the $3 basic rolls available on those days.", "date": "2013-12-29 00:07:35"}, {"review_id": "qbL5YI50DFe3JKM6vYcBZg", "user_id": "CmdAdoH8xaxwaT96TthraA", "business_id": "zitXLajbETOuHQJfok4a4g", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Excellent burger and the best onion strings ever and a glass of wine.

I'm from California and was in Vegas for the weekend with my family, needless to say trip was less than a celebration. Friday night when arriving to our hotel thankfully that's were car gave out. It overheated and just died in the middle of parking lot stopping traffic as it was in the way to parking structure. AAA very quickly arrived  as I explained the situation, towed my car to a parking space. Advice to have it towed to a mechanic first thing in the morning to get it checked; he provided two shops info to contact them in the morning as he knew lots of shops weren't open on the weekends. As soon as I woke up Saturday at 7am, I started calling the shops with no luck since they weren't opening till 8am, finally I got a hold of the closest shop to my hotel and they sadly told me they weren't able to assist me until sometime next week that wasn't doable or an option for me since I only had reservations till Sunday and had to get home by Sunday. So I went down the list of approved AAA shops and got a hold of Imperial Auto & Truck Service and I can't recalled who answered the phone but he was very polite and pleasant and did tell me that I could bring in the car but couldn't guarantee to have it fix today. I walked in the shop like a lost puppy not knowing where to go but as soon as I approach the front desk here came Ariel (my angel) she was so nice and could see my desperation in my face to the point where I broke down crying feeling helpless, she came around and hugged me offering me comfort. She got up to talk to the owner Loren who then came and introduced himself and same as Ariel tried to comfort me introducing me to the whole staff; he said they were gonna take a look at my car and keep me posted. Ariel and Drew the other owner of the shop both kept me updated on the progress of my car. I felt like a fool, I couldn't stop crying, but they all made me feel better even offered me tacos as it was their lunch time and stayed opened past their business hours to make sure I was gonna be driving home Sunday! And I did! Talk about customer service! I can honesty say they are all one happy Family like Drew one of the owners told me that day trying to comfort me.. you guys saved my disaster of birthday weekend, thanks to you guys I was able to enjoy the rest of my weekend with my son and my mom!

I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. \nI returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences.

Bar Hop Brewco might be another good choice for you. They offer 36 in-house brewed beers and almost 100 bottle beers. Their yummy snack are only $5-$9.

They were pretty drunk before they even got in there.\u00a0 I didn't want to argue with them because I dint think they could understand anything at that time .\u00a0 So we just stood there and waited for another barrel table.\u00a0 We ordered beers to start with and waited for almost another half an hour for a real table  that we could sit and eat.\u00a0 I'm a big eater!\u00a0\n\nFood\n Appetizer\n - My luv  \"Pan Seared Mushrooms\"  It was delicious!\u00a0 They were roasted with garlic and glazed with\u00a0 porter  It was a generous portion with a $5 price.\u00a0 If you love mushroom, you would love it! \n - Pork Cracklings\u00a0  One word \"Huge!\"  And only $5.\n - BBQ Tertilla Chips $5 was worth money for its portion.\u00a0 It was also good with beers.\n\n Main\n - Fried Chicken Sandwich $15.\u00a0 It was fine for us but nothing was special.\u00a0 We'd prefer big puffy butter fried chicken sandwich \n\nAtmosphere\u00a0\n - Atmosphere was great and clean.

Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.\n\nI ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik/pork/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu/veg and the tofu/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue. \n\nEverything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service.

Our stroller was bought as a gift online for $560. Now it was online for $399 so I called the Target.com phone number since the stroller was purchased online and asked for a price adjustment. They said I would have to put my stroller back in the box, return it in store or mail it back, & repurchase online to get the credit & they would ship me another stroller. Kind of a hassle but I thought $160+ was worth it. So when I got off work, I look up the stroller online to make sure it's still available and it is NOWHERE to be found on the Target website. I call the online number, spoke to 2 different people and both said I could purchase through the phone at the price I saw online, $399. So I box the stroller back up, drive to my nearest Target, explain to Jesus & what does he do? Dismiss everything I explained, he asks me to login to my registry, scans the stroller box & says, \"Whoa! That's a lot of money!\" Refunds to a gift card $611.48, scans it again, tells me it's now $279.96. I was like, \"okay!\" Obviously I wasn't going to argue with that price when I was originally going for the \"$399.99\" price. Lol He hands me my gift card and tells me, you have a credit of $308.84 left on the gift card. I thank him and we walk out with our stroller. Definitely a big score! I had been dreading the inconvenience of having to wait to get my other stroller in the mail. So walking out with my same stroller was awesome. I went home and set it up again & I also ended up purchasing our baby monitor and glider from the Target website with the credit we received. I could not be happier. :)\n\nAbout 3 days later, I walked in to return a baby bath tub for store credit.

I thought I would need blonde highlights throughout, but she said she could get it closer to the look in the photos.  \n\nWe went over colors, she gave suggestions and input based on my skin tone. - From that moment on, I felt comfortable.  She was really taking her time. - Asking lots of questions, discussing what would look best and what would be less harsh on my hair.\nShe foiled me up, gave me a conditioning treatment, added a little more color, then cut, dried and styled.

It is a phenomenon.\n\nMuch has been written here and elsewhere about this international mega-chain which specializes in moderately-priced, well-designed contemporary modular (i.e.,assemble-it-yourself) furniture and home accessories. Ikea is exactly what it purports to be, so there is not much I can add to its description. \n\nAs I write this post, 28 February 2009, I am having a hard time believing my first experience at the Charlotte location of this Scandinavian retail giant.  It opened only ten days ago, and apparently the circus-attraction atmosphere hasn't worn off yet. Picture this: today was wet, windy, and  foggy. It rained incessantly. Yet, when we approached the Ikea \"campus\" via North Tryon Street, there were blockaded traffic lanes, a half dozen patrol cars, and not less than a mile of bumper-to-bumper traffic waiting to get into the parking lot. Incredible. It was as if the economic crisis never happened. I was amazed.\n\nThe giant store apparently has only one main entrance and exit, much like its big box cousins. That was particularly inconvenient on a day like today, where staying dry was a challenge. Once inside guests were funneled upstairs via escalator to begin their march around the massive showroom. Everyone was encouraged to grab a courtesy tape measure, pencil, and store map on which to make those all-important pre-purchase notations. \n\nThe displays were massive, impressive, and incessant. I thought the furnished recreations of a living space that indicated its square footage an especially effective way to illustrate how Ikea furnishings, heavily oriented toward efficiency, work well in small, tight spaces. I had to chuckle ironically however, since many of the living spaces I've seen since moving to Charlotte are anything but small or tight, quite the contrary. But given the current economy, maybe more folks will be downsizing (I'm thinking of multiple-family McMansions with kids using closets as bedrooms- hee hee). At any rate, Ikea certainly knows how to present its information clearly and effectively, and I'm sure they'd gladly do McMansions as well as small urban spaces.\n\nMy biggest beef with Ikea, however, is purely personal. For one thing, any store with arrows on the floor indicating the direction I should walk gives me the creeps, regardless of the crowd size. I don't enjoy being herded into a space and then being compelled to move through it in any direction except the one I choose. Second, I am just not a big fan of the whole box store shopping experience, where the sheer space and quantity of stuff outweighs my eye's ability to focus on detail. I feel certain, judging by the size of the crowd, that my opinion represents the minority, but that's just me. \n\nI will give Ikea props in the kitchen and bath design department, where the concept of modularity and space-consciousness works well. It also appears the Ikea staff are well-trained and prepared to help customers with both the design and planning in those areas. \n\nI am sure I will return to Ikea, if for no other reason than I'd like to spend more time trying to focus on the design aspect of its furnishings and accessories. But until the massive crowds and homeland security-like police presence calm down, I will continue to delay my next Ikea shopping experience. Today's tightly-controlled visit reminded me more of a trip to the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport than, say, my last outdoor concert where I saw Radiohead. I will follow the direction of the crowd-police for Radiohead, but not for kitchen cabinets.

The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store. \n\nPROS:\n- Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful. \n- Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays. \n- Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef.\n- Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.\n\nCONS: \n- They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening. \n- They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store. \n- The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite.

Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.\n\nWhen ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!\n\nHow could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!  \n\nI would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.

It was a fantastic experience which I highly recommend for everyone. But as we walked through it, and especially as I saw all the wide-eyed kids captivated by what they were seeing, it saddened me that a huge number of Phoenician families simply can't afford the tickets. $20 for adults, $15 for kids as young as 3. Do they really need to charge 15 bucks for a 3 or 4 year old to see this with parents? Come on. The exhibit took us about 90 minutes to complete. I'm docking two stars just because of the price, which is shameful for a so-called nonprofit to be charging the public. \n\nPrice aside, the exhibit is wonderful. It's in Phoenix until May 4, 2008. To avoid standing in line, I recommend buying tickets on-line as we did, though there is a fee for that. \n\nYou start off by being handed a somewhat cheesy \"ticket\" of one actual passenger who traveled on the Titanic, with some basic information about him or her. The exhibit wants to put you in the actual shoes of that person as you walk through, which I thought was effective. Only at the end of the exhibit do you find out whether your passenger survived the sinking or not. \n\nI chuckled at the passenger I was assigned to, who was a prominent Frenchman traveling to Montreal, Quebec for the purpose of designing a bust of the then Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfred Laurier. Of course I felt a personal connection to Monsieur Chevre, as a former Canadian Prime Minister and Montrealer myself. My companion was assigned a 21-year old Englishwoman who had bought a 2nd class ticket, and was traveling with family to New York for her wedding to an American. \n\nThe exhibit is designed to be a comprehensive lesson on the Titanic. It sheds light on how artifacts were discovered and retrieved from the ocean, the design and building of the ship, what the interior rooms looked like for 1st class and 3rd class passengers, lifestyle and daily routines on the deck, and finally the collision with an iceberg and sinking of the ship. Over 1500 dead, out of over 2000. \n\nHundreds of artifacts are on display, from personal items, to fine cutlery, to a door taken from the ship. The one that struck me the most was an old uniform top that still had its owner's faded name, \"Broom\", on it. Mr Broom was a first class steward who perished with the ship. All of the artifacts bring to life a snapshot of the world as it was in April of 1912. Even if you're not interested in the Titanic itself (and I am not), anyone who enjoys history would enjoy this. \n\nThere was a guy dressed up as a passenger there who, to my amazement, either had an incredibly impressive fake Irish accent (and I fancy myself as pretty good at detecting fake accents), or he was actually an Irishman. I decided not to ask him directly because answering me would require him to step out of character. He was somewhat knowledgeable about the ship, as I found out by asking him about the decision to have only 20 lifeboats instead of the 32 that could have saved every passenger on board. The cut was essentially made for the sake of having a nice view from the deck. Nice work, ship designers. \n\nI will say that the analytical lawyer side of me was slightly disappointed by not seeing much that focused on the factors that caused the ship to hit an iceberg and sink. There are exhibits telling the basic story, but I was left wanting just a bit more. Still, by the time we reached the end and excitedly looked up our Frenchman and Englishwoman on the manifest to see if they lived or died, we were delighted to have finally seen this exhibit. We cracked up as we saw one 8 year old girl ironically complain to her mommy that \"her\" passenger died even though he was \"really really rich\". \n\nMonsieur Chevre and the young Englishwoman, it turns out, both lived.", "date": "2007-12-09 01:08:09"}, {"review_id": "bT9EGhC5q4W695M33xwp7A", "user_id": "8TyAAhpneXVgxuQidiiKKg", "business_id": "Yq8ASf8OS7SEs1dXHsfwwA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I used this company and Joey an employee was amazing and quick cleaner.

No one picks up their dog feces. They never have bags for people to pick up their dog feces because one person steals them all for themselves and the lazy ass office bitches refuse to fill it up even though one of them works every day.

It has the usual thin walls and difficult to clean surfaces. You can hear everything from your neighbors having sex to the bass from their music. There is no parking at all.

I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.\n\nI did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the \"oops\" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can't think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.\n\nI am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he'd performed and had a fine time touring Elvis' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I'd experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! \n\nShame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world's ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul's purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over. \n\nSincerely,\n\nNicholas Kafantaris", "date": "2015-03-18 18:22:37"}, {"review_id": "U-tO27tZf82OaCWqVCJq0w", "user_id": "oBhQMjrT0zdSLdlybWRA_w", "business_id": "NCFwm2-TDb-oBQ2medmYDg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This is still one of my favorite sights in Las Vegas. \u00a0I don't get tired of watching this over and over again for the combination of designs and choreography to assorted pieces of music in a beautiful setting. \u00a0Ahhhhh...", "date": "2017-04-30 04:39:34"}, {"review_id": "HKDQ1noBH2O6lCMP4ktY_w", "user_id": "xdW2zehpCYsdXCLnbYABeg", "business_id": "cA3758wmDHz5nK05WY98dg", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I borrowed a friends Costco card with the sole purpose of purchasing the Cackalacky Cheerwine bbq sauce, little did I know I would walk out spending over $100.

Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters! \n\nThe second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people. \n\nOverall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though. \n\nThe brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!\n\nThe food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay.

At 6:00PM on a Saturday night, we arrived promptly at the newly renovated restaurant and was greeted by their hostess, Doris, who was warm and friendly.  My party of seven took the remaining reserved table available in this cozy, dimly-lit restaurant.  The decor was simple yet relaxingly sophisticated.  The main entrance was lined by large open windows and the kitchen, situated at the opposite end of the restaurant, offered a glimpse into the brainchild of this joint.  At the pass, stood chef/owner Jacky Lo, ready to command his troops with military precision.\n\nFour members at my table were actually back on their 2nd/3rd visit and I was advised that everything on the menu was to be desired.  Our server was knowledgeable and helped us navigate through the plethora of Italian jargon and we all agreed to order to share.  We settled on the following from their new menu:\n\nCornish Hen x 2\nSteak Frites\nDuck Confit\nParmigiano Reggiano\nRainbow Trout\n\nAlmost immediately after placing our order, we were surprised by some bread paired with a side trio of sun dried tomatoes, olives, and anchovies.  The table was torn as to which of the three complemented the toasted bread but we managed to clear the plates within minutes.  Personally, I enjoyed the anchovies the most as their saltiness just hit the spot.  Not normally an olive lover, I found the olives to be fruity and fragrant.\n\nAs the main course came out, the first thing I noticed was the clean presentation.  As for each dish:\n\nSteak Frites - Done sous-vide style, I had never experienced a piece of beef that was done so perfectly a medium rare (as recommended by our server).  This is in agreement with Meagen B.'s review.  The only complaint that I had was that I was required to share this dish with 6 other people but that's of no fault to the restaurant.  Interestingly, the frites were actually my favourite part of this dish as the potatoes were thickly cut, crunchy on the outside, and soft and buttery on the inside!  Mmm, yum.\n\nCornish Hen - The hen arrived already de-boned with a crispy, golden brown skin and sitting on a bed of beluga lentil and carrots.  A bite into the hen revealed a hint of sweet alcohol which we later discovered was from the shiaoxing wine marinade.  Not necessarily my favourite dish but others seemed to really like it.\n\nDuck Confit - Normally confined to dried pasta from a box, Lardon's fresh pasta was a first for me.  The duck was succulent but what sealed the deal for me was the sweet pieces of pear that accented the dish.  Nice!\n\nRainbow Trout - This was probably the star of the entrees and really the best bang for your buck.  The trout had an amazing smoky flavour that was infused deep within the fish, underneath the crispy skin.  I highly recommend this dish especially if you enjoy quinoa!\n\nUnfortunately, I was sitting at the other end of the Parm-Reg so I can't comment on it.  Though, it looked on par with all of the other dishes.\n\nThough full, the entire table shared one of each choice from the dessert menu which included:\n\nCreme Brule - Thick custardy texture, maximum vanilla bean flavour, topped with a crackling sugar crust.  The best I've ever had.\n\nMango-Lemon Grass Sorbet & Berry-Basil Sorbet - The mango sorbet tasted like a perfectly ripe mango while revealing hints of earthy lemon-gress while the berry-basil was just to die for!  Top it all off with a fresh biscotti cookie.  Perfect.\n\nChocolate Mousse - Creamy chocolate mousse tower lined with a cookie crust matched with (if I remember correctly) a blueberry compote.\n\nBacon Maple Syrup Ice Cream - The name says it all.  You need to try this bold dessert on your next visit!\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed a laid back night at Lardon along with good service and a well executed meal.

This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.\n \n\nThe Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!\n\n\nThe Food: \n\n- Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)! \n\nThis aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.\n\nThe only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.\n\n\n- Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry. \n\nWhereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors. \n\n\n- CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!\n\n- Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.\n\n\nOverall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food.

The restaurant is in a sketchy area of town, literally right next door a strip club.  They're located in a run down building, which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended.\nThe menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you're left feeling optimistic.\nBut here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups, staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It's sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything.\nThe food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the \"Ragin Cajun,\" which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed \"meat,\" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the \"meat.\"  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn't eat it.\n\nOverall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it's location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I'll never go back, and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that's the kiss of death.", "date": "2014-08-24 20:48:45"}, {"review_id": "MQxu_QsTlsZGTd22U51jhA", "user_id": "RpLeX_kRHbrW5v5YH-R0nQ", "business_id": "jScBTQtdAt-8RshaiBEHgw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 7, "funny": 5, "cool": 7, "text": "A nice small breakfast spot located across from Siems eye center and Dr. Tran's office.\nI'm not familiar with this area, so it was difficult for me to find this place.\nCame here for late breakfast.\nThe waitress (blond lady) was very nice and cheerful.

Many taco places I have been to in Toronto want to wow customers with garnishments, but they go cheap on the fish.  They either use fish fillets not fresh enough, or choose a type of fish that is not meaty AND make the fillet too small, so the texture of the fillet is completely overshadowed by a big pile of garnishments.  The Combine Eatery passes the standard.  Yes, the tacos are expensive  The fillets are Basa fillets, a non-meaty fish.  Yet the fillet is big enough that the fish flavour comes through the garnishments, which are fresh.  The texture of the fish fillet stand up to the volume of the garnishments.  The fillet is fresh.

The human body isn't flat!  No way!  I'm pretty sure I've seen a lot of people with circles in their tattoos before.  I have a tattoo on me already that was at least as complicated as the design I brought in to cyclops that they essentially refused to do.  I appreciate that the artist I talked to was honest about what he thought would happen if he tried it, but given that there are about 100 other places on carson to get tattoos I was surprised that he was so rude.  I definitely would have been thankful for expert advice about how to improve the design, but we didn't get anywhere by him simply deriding it.  I also appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerful and respectful, but my previous tattoo was done by someone much less apparently put upon when asked to try a challenging design.  \n\nIn the end I'm glad that I didn't get tattooed here, because I wouldn't want someone that treated me that way stabbing me with needles.  I give them two stars instead of one though because the place was very neat and clean, and the example art on the walls looked pretty good (but to my inexperienced eye equally as complicated, if not more so, as what I wanted but was refused).

Keep this in mind if you are thinking of coming here.  I feel 100% satisfied with my hair color service by Jaymee.  I also enjoyed the complimentary hand and arm massage I received from Rachel.  Overall I give the service I received 5 stars!  My ombre dye job cost $50, after I saved $11 from buying the Groupon.  What a great deal!  My suggestion would be to request a Phase 2 student (especially Jaymee!) if you are planning to get a color service.  It is well worth the extra ~$10.

Everything within an hour Vegas was BOOKED solid, and I mean solid. I was able to find one of the lodges 2 hours out of town that had space, so I was set. \n\n***Here is the important part of the entire review: I got a discount because it was PREPAID.\n\nI got off of work, made it to the airport on time, checked in early, everything a-ok, even had my print out of my reservation and info to pick up my car rental at 10pm on Friday. I go to the ticket counter, and the staff is taking their time. Fine, I can still make it to the lodge on time and check in. This is also important, because the front desk is not open 24 hours. After midnight your screwed. The receptionist was willing to wait up til 1am for me to check in, though. But no later, as this place is so small no one else is at the desk until 5am. With only a few people in line in front of me, I should be ok.\n\nNope. Staff is so incompetent and computer system is so archaic that 30 minutes passes before the NEXT person is served. The manager tries to get people to use the Hertz electronic kiosk, as she can tell we are all frustrated with how SLOW the service is. I'm a savvy travel and think this should not be a problem and take the kiosk route with a few others. But the couple in front of me have issues with their reservation, and flag down the manager to help them (she is VERY pregnant and can't deal with the stress of 10 minutes of nothing working).\n\nMy turn at the kiosk. I try several different methods to get my reservation. Scan my print out. Type in my reservation number. Put in my credit card info again. 15 minutes of attempts, and nothing. By now I would've been in the front of the line. Finally the kiosk recognizes me, and tells me to SEE AN ATTENDANT about my issue. I get back in line and wait another 10 minutes before anyone can help me (thank God they didn't put me in the BACK of the line again). \n\nAt this point I WASTE another 10 minutes as the reservations agent at the terminal can't get my reservation to go through, despite the print out and online info on my phone. THEY ARE SURE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY, BUT NOT GIVE YOU THE CAR. They cannot take the credit card I provided. YET THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY. \nWhen I showed them that I had been charged already (yes, I brought out my bank transactions, this has happened before and this usually works) they STILL WOULD NOT RENT ME THE CAR I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR. \n\nNow the manager gets involved, as she can sense my frustration with the staff to a perfectly simple and logical transaction. And what can she do about it? Nothing. Not willing to get on the phone and talk to Hertz, or to over ride. Is this for REAL? A rental service that operates 24 hours a day and you can't get anyone on the phone to fix this issue? And she wasn't going to try? EVEN THOUGH THE RESERVATION FOR THE RENTAL WAS PREPAID AND YOU TOOK MY MONEY?!\n\nBy now in my anger I had missed the call that the receptionist at the lodge was checking in with me. Whatever TIME I had buffered to make it to the extended deadline to check in at the lodge was now SLIPPING AWAY. Knowing that my frustration was mounting, I walked away and waited in line at another car rental agency and got a car. \n\nThat's right. Walked up, waited in line 5 minutes, talked to an agent from a competitor and got them to MATCH MY CAR TYPE AND DISCOUNT with HERTZ and get the paperwork car within 10 minutes TOTAL. I went back to the HERTZ desk and asked to make sure I was getting a REFUND FOR A CAR RENTAL THAT WAS PREPAID THAT I WAS  *NOT* GETTING. \n\nGuess what the manager said?\n\nNo.\n\nAt this point I cussed out the agent that initially helped me and the manager because they know NOTHING about customer service. You can't release the cat to the same credit card you were MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE PREPAID MONEY FROM, and WON'T REFUND THE MONEY when you can't give me the car. No print out that says I was NOT given my car when I call Hertz billing come Monday. \n\nBy now it's 11:30pm Friday night when I drive off in a non-HERTZ car, and I have to fly like a bat out of hell to make the deadline at the lodge. I would have to deal with Hertz later, as I had wasted enough time with them.\n\nI've rambled enough, but in short guess who SLEPT IN THE CAR in the parking lot of the lodge? Surely it wasn't a HERTZ car that I slept in, no sir-ree -bob! \n\nIn summary, even with all the paperwork, print outs, online info and correct identification info on my person, HERTZ would not rent me my prepaid car, nor would they refund it. Due to the length of incompetent  time and poor service I received at Hertz, I did not make my reservation on time at my lodging. \n\nAVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.\n\np.s.

Three baja fish tacos are for $13. If you have only one is $5.\u00a0 We got three. They were very tasty.\n - K-MEX SLAW ($12):\u00a0 We wanted to try something new so we ordered K-Mex Slaw as an appetizer. It came with a huge dish of Korean Cabbage, creamy fresh Mexican Cheese \"Queso Fresco\", fresh Avocado, Corn, and topped with Ginger-Sesame Dressing.\u00a0 It was an interesting dish.\u00a0 However, I am a chip-eater  so I ordered the Guacamole & Chips in the end   I couldn't finish it though.\n - GUACAMOLE & CHIPS ($9): I heard that their Guacamole & Chips were good however, it might not be my day.\u00a0 My chips were a bit burnt and not warm as many people claimed .\u00a0 The Guacamole was good though.\u00a0\n - GRILLED KALBI BEEF RIBS ($14): My husband ordered the ribs instead of the special steak taco that was run out.\u00a0 He said these Korean Short Ribs were very good.\u00a0 The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa and Cucumber-Radish Kimchi made the dish more delicious. The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa brought a kick of\u00a0 spiciness. As I mentioned, if you like a taste of Korean food, you would like these Korean Short Ribs.\u00a0\n - *Dipping/ Hot sauces: Don't forget to ask for their house hot sauces! It is the MUST if you love spicy! I asked for it a bit late when I was about to fish my tacos .\u00a0 I didn't plan well..I didn't plan well!\u00a0 It came with four small bowls of different hot sauces.\u00a0 The red one is the spiciest!!! \n\nDrinks: \nIt's a bit harsh if you don't have Mexican food with alcohol, isn't it!?  Makes your journey a bit more fun with Michelada! A Mexican drink made with cold beer \"Modelo Especial ($7)\" and mixed with clamato juice, freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.\u00a0 I normally don't like Bloody Caesar or a drink with hot sauce.\u00a0 However, this MICHELADA ($7+$2) totally changed my mind.\u00a0 I became a spicy-drink lover . \u00a0\n\nBarrio Coreano also have other interesting cocktails.\u00a0 They are $12-$14.\u00a0 We didn't get any cocktails this time.\u00a0 We had only Michelada and Beau's Nordic Pale Ale (600ml for $12).\u00a0 The Nordic Pale Ale is brewed in Ontario.\u00a0 It was dry and low to medium bitter. \u00a0\n\nDessert:\n - CHURROS POUTINE:  a sweet version of Poutine.\u00a0 Sweet Churros dipped in a rock glass filled with warm caramel and melted marshmallows . The dessert that you will fall in love with\u00a0 if you like SWEET.\u00a0 \n\nService:\n - Reservation: It is a good idea if you make a reservation.\u00a0 We didn't do it though.\u00a0 Luckily they had a small spot for us at the time because the customers was about to leave when we got in .\u00a0 Make sure you ask your server for everything you may want at once so you won't miss anything and don't have to wait.\u00a0 They seem to be busy in the evening, especially on weekends.\u00a0\n\nPrice:\u00a0 In my opinion, it's a bit on high price side for some items.\u00a0 However, taco prices are average.\u00a0 I would recommend to order one each of tacos to try out with their house hot sauces.\u00a0 A bottle of beer would be nice with spicy food~\u00a0\n\nOVERALL is good", "date": "2017-05-13 06:08:40"}, {"review_id": "D0k35eM00noARoK2KQFpgg", "user_id": "h3q7CXdmUX5cisXHk3dkHQ", "business_id": "1qwkbN3wu3AGDxMTXVz2gA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'll have to say as a first time visit here this place was great the food was good and the service from the staff was great the options of games to play on a driving range were awesome definitely not a boring night will definitely go again", "date": "2015-10-07 21:18:16"}, {"review_id": "E2dHC1I-FWmSYC7R22-udw", "user_id": "PXcCtbuqccN-5BdyOeCEjg", "business_id": "KbhrsTQEea2RF_94YWnBdQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great Food, very busy around 11-1.

There were also a few entrees and some desserts out, but I'm not sure if those were already being put out for lunch, or if they had them out during breakfast as well.   The blueberry pancake was amazing (not standard individual pancakes, more of a bluberry pancake batter baked into a dish and scooped out with a spoon).    Lunch was decent...there was nothing in particular that stood out, although the desserts were pretty good (loved the chocolate tart).    Similarly, dinner was reasonably good but there was nothing that was particularly amazing or stood out.  The roast beef at the carving station was probably my favorite.

We decided to see what's the hype in this prestigious duck.  Throughout the dinner, we experienced up-selling of the duck, why this duck is worth the price. Each employee had said different things - so here is a consolidation of the differences between $88 and $118 according to the restaurant:\n\nThe $88 duck is a 4 lb duck, vs $118 is an 8 lb duck.  Only the bigger duck have enough surface area to carve out the peony flower.  This flower presentation is also copyrighted in China as of 2014 - therefore you can only experience the unique presentation at their restaurants.\n\nThe duck is LOCAL. Regardless what they say, these ducks are not flown in from Beijing.  A waiter did tell us only the $118 is from a specialty farm, vs $88 is not (we asked the Manager to get the right story)\n\nThe pastry/pancake is from Beijing - to maintain its \"quality\". \n\nThe finely green spring onions are specially ordered from a vendor - as it is unique in its \"fine chopping skill\"\n\nWhen you receive the duck at your table for the presentation of the carving, you will be given a show, including a \"gong\" to start the show, and to see how the peony is created.  \n\nWas this duck good? It was tasty. However as the skin was so finely carved out, I found it was difficult to appreciate the crispiness of the skin. \n\n3 stars for the service - we did get a lot staff which came to explain to us on the restaurant history, the food detail, and explanation of the menu. We had a staff specially stayed around to serve us (why? I don't know why, he just floated next to us). HOWEVER, everyone was very courteous, and we appreciate their consistently walkthrough of each dishes and story-telling.\n\nWere the other food good? They were all very flavourful - however generally more greasy, with higher price then typical Chinese restaurant.  We anticipated to have the Squirrel Fish, which unfortunately the waiter forgot to put into our order (our table did not make a big deal, as he was very courteous.

I spoke with Michael too, at exit of my last cleaning using their 12 month $299 plan, on 2/28/18.  He gave me options going forward for the 2 plans they offer and he said \"NO NEED to choose one now since I don't have a cleaning scheduled till 5/31/18.\"  He said \"the plan is 12 mos so you'll waste 3 mos of that waiting till 5/31/18.\"  I knew this already and was not going to choose either plan that day.  He made NO mention of needing to sign a letter rejecting an automatic renewal of that plan [which I was totally unaware of] by the next day 3/1/18.  Lo and behold, when paying my Capital One card Sunday 3/11/18 I see Cherrington Dental charged me $299 on that very next day, 3/1/18, without my consent.  Not only that, they DID NOT send me a receipt for that $299, so I had no idea it was done.  Had I not gone over my charges as usual I would have missed it.  Pretty low down sneaky and rotten thing to do to a patient of 1 year!  Where was the question, do you want to renew for another year, or change plans?  Or, will you have insurance this year??  Questions never asked.  \n\nThis is supposed to be a dental practice helping/caring for patients.  So, I called the Dental office and was told by Angie that Michael & Tammy were busy, that no charge reversal would be done, and that I would receive a return call that afternoon - 3/13/18.  Of course, no call came 3/13 or 3/14, so today 3/15/18 I called Capital One to start a dispute to reverse this nonsense.\n\nNow we've had 4 days of grief in our house due to this, and I'm out a perfectly fine hygienist with a need to find another Dental office.\n\nTo anyone reading I would, and now have to, look elsewhere for a Dental office that earns my trust.", "date": "2018-03-15 19:17:52"}, {"review_id": "z6PGOaWC7_u3bwr-Z0Y8gg", "user_id": "HnAJxyYoZFtgsKdTWuK9nA", "business_id": "qx6WhZ42eDKmBchZDax4dQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Took my daughter to celebrate her passing the second block of nursing school with our entire family, the service was out of this world.

The previous day, I was sightseeing, walking through the casino, and NA caught my eye!  They have a menu outside their front doors and I observed it.  Well, I saw that they have Pho!!! I loooove Pho and it is difficult to find in my hometown area.  So right away, I knew I already wanted to come back and try it.  When I got back to my hotel, I read a few Yelp reviews and saw pictures from my fellow Yeeps Ken L and Mike O. \n\nI came back next day, before opening 11am Monday morning.  I got there 15 minutes early and a line was already forming!  I think I was the 4th person and by the time they opened, I am sure there were at least 30 people waiting.  I got the impression that this was a great sign and people in line were ready to get in and order lunch!!  The restaurant is very open area, lots of space, and nice decor.  I liked it very much and felt comfortable seated at my table.  There are lots of tables and I also saw a counter area. \n\nMy server came over and took my order.  I still looked over the menu while I was waiting and there are soooo many items on there that I would love to try, but I specifically came back for the \"Pho Prime\".  OK, this is the most Expensive Pho I have ever bought at $16.95.  I normally pay 7-8$ for a bowl at other places in Nor Cal.  But that being said, I really didn't care about the price, if I want something, I buy it and plus I was on vacation in Vegas... have to Enjoy every moment to the fullest :)\n\nThe Pho Prime was Delicious.  It had a great flavor in the broth, lots of meats, lots of noodles, and I enjoyed eating it  BUT, No Hoisin sauce, it didn't come with my plate so I asked for it and my server said they ran out yesterday??  The Pho Prime is a huge bowl too, I could not finish it.  It was definitely worth the price and place!  My server was OK, and she was busy with other tables as well.  I was disappointed I couldn't order a dessert, 3 of 4 choices that I wanted to try on the menu were out!!!  At first I almost didn't believe it lol, like for real?  I really wanted to order the Hawaiian Papaya :/  so I decided not to get a dessert, changed my mind.  Then it took awhile for me to get the bill, I was waiting...\n\nOverall, I had a very good lunch and Yes, I would definitely return!  Considering the location, how much I like the Venetian casino, and all the menu options that I read sounded tasty.  Hopefully, the next time I am in town I can come in and order a big dinner.  This is a great place for couples or groups, plenty of seating.

I like breading and crunch on my fish, so that suited me quite well. The rice was lovely, though there wasn't much. The veg was slightly over-steamed green beans (my guest got steamed asparagus with his steak). I'd called that \"fish and veggie,\" no \"s\", but that's just a quibble. \n\nAs previous reviewers have mentioned, you're hunting your food around the plate and more than once (especially with something like green beans, that can be hard to keep on a fork when you CAN see what you're doing!) you'll get a fork to your mouth only to discover there's nothing on it.\n\nThe desserts were sorbet and chocolate mousse. The mousse was delectable, though it had some sort of soft brownie or cake beneath; I literally couldn't get just one mouthful cut off and found myself with a HUGE chunk that needed to be nibbled off in the dark. I felt like a little kid, because without my napkin to scrub my face, I'd have left the room with chocolate *everywhere* on my face. \n\nI know some people find the \"atmosphere\" straining or uncomfortable in the dark. I was actually with a friend who is usually quite quiet, but was much *more* animated in the dark and we had a wonderful chat while we enjoyed our food.\n\nThe room is *dark*.

First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers. \n\nWe started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.\n\nFor our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency. \n\nChicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none. \n\nThe Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of saut\u00e9ed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion. \n\nThe food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus. \n\nWith the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was \"we are really busy and need you to leave right now.\" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that. \n\nI can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill. \n\nThe two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive.", "date": "2015-02-16 05:34:44"}, {"review_id": "g0cM5OPn9wd_imB6jmmPaA", "user_id": "bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ", "business_id": "arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "After seeing the photos of the bacon tempura, we had to give this place a try!

These days it's also a great local store that carries fashion accessories (mostly female), jewelry, toys, giftware, home d\u00e9cor, novelty items and other seasonal items.

I'm a bit disappointed they don't showcase much of their wedding accessories/d\u00e9cor in-store as this was the primary reason for our visit.

On the paperwork it says the presentation lasts for 2-2 and a half hrs. Well when we showed up, our salesman told us we would be with him for the next 3 hrs. He was so nice at first, got along with my friend and I, laughed a lot and then when we asked how much the timeshare was, he wouldn't answer and kept changing the subject. He took us outside to show us the \"beautiful view\" which was dead desert. Not too beautiful to me. He walked us to the common room where people hangout and watch tv, everyone had to be 75 yrs and older, I am 30. It seemed more like a retirement home than a timeshare. I noticed it had been over two hrs and thanked him for his time but we weren't interested. He said we were not allowed to leave until the 3 hrs was up. I told him I signed a paper which said I only had to stay for two to two and a half hrs. He said if we left we would not receive the free things we were promised. So at this point we have literally been blackmailed and kidnapped since what I signed said I could leave after two hrs.  I figured we could tough it out since it would only be another 45 minutes. That 45 minutes felt longer than the first 2 hrs. These guys don't know the word no, they do not listen to you and they turn into assholes after they know you won't buy from them. I said no about 30 times and the manager walks up, tells us a guy is selling his timeshare and I can get it for the price of $12,000. Half price of what the timeshare was (which was a complete lie) I said no. He then lowered it to $4,000. Again, I said no. He then offered me the timeshare for free and all I had to do was pay the $1,000 taxes each year and put down $1400 today and my week stays would be the $209 a week. I swear if I had to hear them say \" and for ONLY $209 a week you can stay ANYWHERE in the world\" one more time, I was going to scream. They made my friend cry out of frustration of not allowing us to leave  at the 3 hr mark and they kept pressuring us and wouldn't sign the paper saying we finished the presentation. It was like they wanted to make us so mad I would just sign up so they would shut up. When you don't listen to a girl when she says no, hold her against her will and make her cry and say sexual remarks about her body the entire time it's a close feeling to being sexually abused.....not okay.....At 3 hrs and 20 minutes we were finally told we could leave.....finally free. We were sent to another room to tell a man how our presentation went. As my friend was still crying we told him how awful it was. He had to fill out a questionnaire on our answers and the question on the page said \"how was the presentation\" after we told him how awful they were to us I saw him write \"good\" on the answer line.....he straight up lied on their questionnaire! I then was sent to another man to get my 4 free nights at the Luxor and my $200 deposit back. He said it would take two days to be put back into my account. It took over a week. When we got on the bus, everyone had similar stories. I was the only one who was dumb enough to put a $200 deposit down.

I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it.

On top of all of that, they sent out a sample of a dessert liquor and dessert, a sample appetizer, and some champagne on the house. I kid you not- we asked for an experience and they gave us one.

They use lacquered chop sticks, rather than throw-away wooden ones as used by Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon.  The lacquered ones look classy, but are harder to use.  Tougher to hold onto the noodles.  Unlike other places, they bring the spoons and small empty dishes later, along with the meal.  My problem with that is that I cannot mix my dipping sauce while waiting for the rest of the stuff.  Also, they don't immediately bring out sprouts and greens and sliced peppers, which come out just before the pho.

Let me start by saying that I enjoy what I call \"casual elegance.\" I like good upscale food, in a modern, casual atmosphere, with a laid back nice, but down to earth vibe. Somewhere like SIX PENN Kitchen or something. I decided to come here after reading many great reviews on Yelp. This place is comical, trys wayy to hard!\n\nIt is very small, tables very close. Low ceiling/dark paint so it feels very claustrophobic. It does describe itself as a lounge so I will give them that; if you like swanky lounge vibe this place is actually pretty nice. Too dark and small for my liking. The waiter, dressed in his skinny jeans and pompadour brought over a bottle of tap water to pour. We politely decline b/c I didn't want water so why waste it..ya know. He seemed offended that I didn't want water, he offered us wine, and we declined, I just wanted a diet coke because I was on call for work and could not drink. He became aloof, almost took it as a personal assault that we didn't want wine!\n\nI ordered an appetizer and the waiter asked my BF which one he wanted, the waiter said, \"Oh you want to share the appetizer\" I said I assumed it was for 2 people, as most appetizers at almost any place can serve more than one person, and it didn't specify that they were single serve. The waiter was rude, as if I should have already known this information. \n\nSo we were brought bread, a variety and this was actually fantastic. I was thinking that my meal would be great and the stuffy atmosphere would be worth it...I was wrong. I had pork shoulder that tasted like Walmart/enhanced meat. It was tough, fatty. Served with puree sweet potato that tasted like baby food. BF had \"seared\" tuna, that was just rubbery, nasty, no flavor. I'd give the meal 4/10...no lie a pork dinner from Bob Evans is better. \n\nI think this place needs to learn that sometimes less is better. Simple dishes can be better, dont need a thousand ingredients to be good. Overall the the atmosphere is what kills it. Its forced elegance. \n\nPass.

The menu gives you a lot of options. You can have chicken, fish or tofu burritos, tacos, or all kinds of plates.  Jonathon at the register was extremely friendly and recommended the enchiladas. You basically order once you come in, they give you a number and then you sit and watch the awesome projector showing extreme sports clips of guys eating it and doing gnarly tricks.

We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.\n\nThe crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!\n\nThe Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!\n\nMy friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!", "date": "2017-03-15 02:28:50"}, {"review_id": "_VHsH52bXHb5s_OwnmegtQ", "user_id": "RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A", "business_id": "2HxaDXZmAOH6LiuzGgNdPA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 8, "funny": 5, "cool": 7, "text": "As you may have noticed I have been coming here a little to often lol.

I considered it to be over hyped and overrated; however, after a very satisfying early Saturday lunch, I now feel completely different.\n\nWe arrived at 11:00AM and were seated immediately, fortunately in Melissa's section. We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying.\n\nFor our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert. \n\nAs an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not.\n\nAfter drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good!\n\nHey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait.\n\nOverall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun.

Quite a few exemplary choices here, just with the strip prices you'd come to expect.\n\nLet's start with one of the best Fried Chicken dishes you may encounter :\n\nChicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles ($36): Honey Hot Sauce, Chilled Spiced Watermelon, Cheddar Cheese Chow Chow Waffle & Bourbon Maple Syrup. The most tender and juicy fried chicken I've had to date, the waffles crisp and flavorful. I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice, but this was an excellent rendition!  A bit spendy, but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion.\n\nMama's Chicken Biscuits ($14): Free Range Fried Chicken, Pepper Jelly, House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit. Incredibly fluffy, buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken, moist and flavorful. Recommended!  I could eat these biscuits for days :D\n\nLow & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16): Haas Avocado, Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing. Loved the cornbread texture and flavor, the chicken full of flavor and pairing perfectly with the yogurt dressing. Wonderful! \n\nFried Green Tomato 'BLT' ($14): Pork Belly, Greens, Tomato Jam & Pimento Cheese. Succulent pork belly, fat rendered and buttery, with a nice crunchy cornbread and pimento pulling it together. \n\nFried Bread & Butter Pickle Spears ($6): Spicy Salt & Spiked Dukes Mayo. Light breading, similar to Fish & Chips consistency. Dipping mayo very enjoyable!\n\nDeviled Eggs ($11): Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe. Well balanced and fresh, the roe adding just a hint of salt to finish\n\nChicken Liver Toast ($5): Grilled Country Bread, Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish. Mildly mineral in flavor, the acid in the relish complimented well. \n\nFlorida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16): Toasted Peanut Hummus, Basil, Smoked Tomato Sorbet, Field Shoots, Crunchy Puffed Ca. Dressing was very enjoyable with a nice addition of peanut hummus \n\nMacaroni & Cheese ($10): Torchio Pasta, Five Artisanal Cheeses & Crispy Herb Crust. Well rendered, just missing some spice to set it off from the cheese.\n\nCountry Pork Terrine ($10): Pickled Cauliflower, Grilled Country Bread & Whole Grain Mustard. Very heavy and lunch-meat like terrine, it paired well with the mustard. \n\nAnd for dessert :\n\nKey Lime Donut Bites: Coconut Pudding & Mango Jellies. Interesting combination with the citrus, I enjoyed the pudding / mango jelly, light and delicate.\n\nCrunch & Munch Bread Pudding: M&Ms Bread Pudding, Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel. Incredibly sweet, the bread pudding was thick and rich, almost brownie-like.

As I piled into the back of the shuttle, and watched it fill up, I thought to myself, \"This must be a popular place.\" Boy was I wrong. As we all lined up for check in (half of us out the door), the front desk announced that they only had one computer working and it would take some time. I was number 7 in line. As I made it up to the marble counter and said hello to the person checking me in and the 4 others who were behind the desk, I noticed that \"old\" smell..... You know that smell that makes you think mildew? Mold? Nope, it was the natural perfume of the entire building (at least the parts that I was in). I was given my room, and I walked in and noticed a GIANT stain on my recently redone carpet, the light fixture was leaning to one side and falling off the wall, and my AWESOME view was a giant satellite dish and what looked like some rusted out shacks in the parking lot.\nSo I grabbed the remote and was greeted by a bunch of back buttons (the numbers had been worn off). The only one I could read was MENU and it did not work. After figuring out which buttons did what (Thank God I did not end up accidentally buying hotel porn!) I started trying to change the channel. I could change by using the button to look at the next channel up or down the list, but if I hit a number, it would simply sit on the screen. If I wanted channel 24, it would first show channel 2, and after hitting 4 like 5 times, the 2 would be replaced with a 4 and it would sit there until I turned the TV off and turned it back on.\nThis hotel was a lot like the Monday Night Pre-Season Game I was watching... Not inspiring confidence. After calling down to the front desk and asking for a 7:30 shuttle and a 7 am wake up call, I eat my delivered dinner (I dare not try the hotel's food) and set the Hilton Clock in my room for a 6:45 alarm.\n\nThe next morning I woke up on my own at about 6:50 to my alarm clock blinking because the alarm was going off, but the alarm itself was broken. As I walked towards the bathroom, I noticed 2 pieces of paper under my door. It was my bill, but you would not know it. Usually Hilton family hotels print everything (including your bill) on company letter head so you know where it came from. These bills were simply printed on white copy paper.

The primary reason being, the parking lot sucks. There is no shade, so afterwards you're really inclined to take your car to the Costco car wash and fork over $7.99 for a wash.\n\nNow, with the negatives out of the way, I have to say that the Costco has all the requirements of a Costco. Perishables are lumped together, except for dairy, which you have to go down the side to find the dairy cooler. Counter intuitive. It'd be nice if all Costcos could follow the same warehouse schematic, this would make shopping easier for customers.\n\nOr, if Costco does not want to have a unified schematic, then have an app available (yes, that means Costco would need to provision guest wifi access points and available SSID's for connect), so that customers can pull down a user intuitive layout. Marketing opportunity: The customer can then visually see the available items on sale in the store. Pair it along the Costco app or bake the schematic feature directly into the Costco app so that shoppers can shop smarter.\n\nAlso, as of early 2016, Costco now accepts credit cards. I shit you not. They killed their agreement with American Express and instead went with Citibank. Caveat: you can't use your costco business card with Apple Pay. Google it, lot of pissed off customers. \n\nI can't fault a single Costco warehouse for a company wide fault though.\n\nAnyway, there's that review.

Zipps are my favorite, so you get a gist of what type of wings I like. The ranch here is the real deal as well, which makes a difference. Not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use.\n\nThe ONLY issue I have here is that the burgers are cooked WELL done. Xtra well my visit yesterday. BUT, still are great because of the charbroil flavor. I usually order my burgers rare to medium rare (don't have that option here), so I'd rather get a burger at Fuddruckers, but the fries are better here... and the wings and other sides are great options that separate OHW from other restaurants. We had fried zucchini and fried mushrooms as well because my gf's parents ordered them... Everything was more than satisfying and we all had a great dinner! Worth a shot for sure!

My older children were upset that they did not get the chance to go to global minds themselves!  \n\nContrary to some of these negative reviews regarding Adam and his bullying tactics -- i have found that he is beyond understanding and goes out of his way to accommodate families and their situations.  when i signed up for the school - i forgot to pay the deposit, and it was actually ME that had to track him down and make sure that he let me pay (as i didn't remember the exact amount i needed to give him).  i was so worried that i would have lost my spot in the school - but Adam stated that he had held it for me despite my lack of deposit - and was very understanding about the situation.\n\nAdam and all the teachers at the school also helped as my daughter transitioned and potty trained.  before she started she was successfully having no accidents.  in her first week she had 1-2 every day!!! not only did they just help her adjust (and change her with the clothes i provided them) -- but since the second week she didn't have any accidents!  \n\nI can't say enough about this school -- just one visit and you will see for yourself!", "date": "2016-09-30 20:25:44"}, {"review_id": "h8Ytm8knSgYrQS1kxGKCug", "user_id": "E-rm5ng9XW5J3siZzBtHLw", "business_id": "hrk8cTITGnWbK7NIQL6Aew", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "I covered some of this in my review for the Princess of Wales theatre, but I will mention it here.

Having a week off and several friends who were fellow fans of BBQ I decided it was time to make the trip over to Little Miss while I was able to get there early and not have to wait long. Got there about 10:30 and by 11:10 I had a nice plate of juicy meat in front of me ready to go.\n\nLucky enough for me I came on a thursday which meant it was Pastrami day and a platter full of that, fatty brisket, beans, potato salad and an extra housemade sausage for good measure I was ready to indulge in all the essentials for BBQ.\n\nI have to say I was blown away by the flavors and the tenderness of the meat hear. The pastrami was incredible with a blend of spices that was out of this world there was a distinct subtle sweetness that I couldn't put my finger but it was a hit probably the best I have ever had. The fatty brisket was just killer as well with a great tenderness and ton of great smoked flavor. The biggest compliment I can give these two meats is that while I tried them with the various sauces I preferred them without and I am usually the type to slather my BBQ in some sauce.\n\nThe homemade sausage was really good as well and work getting with some great flavor but was overshadowed by the others. The beans are more liked pulled pork with some beans added, in other words outstanding. The potato also didn't disappoint.\n\nOne of the staff also noticed my buddies 2 young children weren't eating anything when told they were picky eaters he said \"let me get the a rib to try kids tend to love them\" and he was nice enough to bring a rib for each youngster. While the kids still didn't go for it after a little test bite the rest of us decided to try and they were very good and fall apart tender as well. In the absence of the Pastrami I would pair the ribs and brisket in a heartbeat for a great meal.\n\nThe finishing touch was the pecan pie which while small is rich enough it should be shared but it will go quick as the smokey sweetness and flaky crust is perfect capper to a great meal.\n\nCompared to Pappy's I may actually give the edge to Little Miss because of the Pastrami but it's neck and neck on ribs and brisket so the end result is that AZ has a BBQ spot that can go toe to toe with some of the best in the midwest.\n\nDon't miss out and make the time to come here.

I had a falafel sandwich, my husband had a chicken shawarma sandwich combo. \n\nBoth were delicious, and my husband claims it is very \"authentic\" (which I believe, although I'm not sure how he got to be an expert on Middle Eastern food since he's only ever eating shawarma in Toronto).  The guy making our sandwiches insisted that my husband have french fries on his sandwich, because \"that is the way they do it back home\" (back home being Lebanon, I asked).  He tried it out and said it was fine, but nothing spectacular.  Sure enough, the guy behind us in line wanted fries on his, and he reiterated \"that's the way they do it at home!\".  So maybe my husband is right, maybe it is really authentic.\n\nThe combo came with fries and 2 sides (choices are babaganoush, hummus, and tabouli).  The falafal balls were made fresh and had a nice crispiness on the outside, and were moist on the inside.  \n\nThe place felt very clean and had that still-new feel to it.  Service was friendly and attentive.  \n\nHowever - and this is a BIG however - the guy working the grill was SWEATING PROFUSELY.  Dripping-down-his-face-and-maybe-onto-the-food-type sweat.  This is HUGE in my opinion, and almost enough to turn me off the place forever.  But I kept a close eye on my sandwich and feel okay about it.  The reason I still give 4 stars, is because I think the food was great, and this place has huge potential, and this one significant issue is relatively easy to fix.  Get a few fans, some better ventilation, and problem hopefully solved.  Also, give the guy a towel in the back to wipe his face on, so that he doesn't have to keep wiping his face on the sleeve of his shirt.  \n\nI'm interested to see if they will maintain a level of cleanliness.

They were basically giant rice crispy cereal pieces - not exactly amazing. \n\nThings went downhill fast when my mother ordered the carne asada tacos.

My mom had lost her appetite, but I settled on the churros. The dainty churros were tossed into a paper bag (I've seen better presentation at the state fair).

I had to throw it in a pan at home and added some sesame oil and other veggies and spices to make it decent enough to eat.

When it came time for the meet and greet we were stopped at security because we were told are tickets would not scan. When we went back to the desk no one seemed to know what was going on with are tickets as all the works scrambled around from computer to computer to try to solve what wad going on.

The front desk told us to go to the meet and greet and they would resolve what was going on when we get back. As we ran frantically down the long hall for the meet greet I couldn't help but think about it the whole time as my partner and sister kept asking if everything was okay. After the meet and greet we returned to the desk when they told us we only had tickets for meet and greet and not the actual show. When I pointed out to the workers that our tickets said GA which stands for general admission and seat 27 they said that my ticket was a mistake and could not explain why it said that. They then basically embarrassed me again and said we do not have tickets for the show. It was at that time I handed the gentleman my credit card and paid an additional 700 something dollars to purchase seats for the show. Almost 4000 dollars later I wanted to cry from the embarrassment from the staff and unprofessionalism experienced. I did not want to disappoint my boyfriend or my sister.

From start to finish, each bite was a wonderful taste treat!\n2. soup of the day was shrimp gumbo. You could tell that this was a long, slow savory journey from cutting board till ending up in my bowl. Marvelous flavor, marvelous kinda-spicy seasoning, marvy aftertaste!\n3. unsweet ice tea is something I'm particular about. Boom! Nailed it. brewed just right ... not sitting in a pitcher of melting ice for a long time before I ordered it ... refills were timely and delivered in a fresh glass ... Delicious Southern tea, just normal tasting, made like it's supposed to be, delicious tea!\n4. half dozen raw oysters. The oyster menu is hidden in a separate menu that is really the drink menu.

As long as they are involved I keep hearing awful things about the show, and them over selling and attendees that already paid year in year out unable to get inside. And of course the blatant dishonesty they caused the artists that attended and the attendees they keep ripping off. If I suck at drawing, then why did I not have the same problem a year before? Take some responsibility for yourselves Hobbystar. Otherwise take a class in management, because you have proven to the public you can't handle the job.\n   It's 2016, and Informa is creating a terrible reputation amongst artists and attendees. I have never dealt with them, but the tables are more expensive, harder to find, and a lot of exhibitors are telling me to look elsewhere. No problem, I am headed to events that treat people better, if anyone else wants to run this, I'll consider returning.", "date": "2015-02-02 03:49:26"}, {"review_id": "D_dmshV_28GHGKFJLdC2lA", "user_id": "8kcB2VEKgwVptdhdtC3EHA", "business_id": "yFOB-eJEIiOM4kIe21T1ZA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Don't go here.

It was in isolation from all the other stores with an open concept that allowed you to see all four floors of the building with the cafe at the very front. We got to Yorkdale at around 1 and because they don't take reservations they told us to come back in an hour. Since the cafe is in Yorkdale we decided to walk around until we got a text. After 30 minutes or so we received a text and made our way back to RH ready to dine. The seats were so spacious and not to mention they were actually super comfortable. I especially loved their marble tables. The entire cafe was just very aesthetically pleasing. \n\nTheir menu was limited so we ended up just ordering a kale salad with a salmon plate since we weren't that hungry anyways. The kale salad was actually a Caesar salad mixed with kale and it was delicious. The salmon salad came with toast cheese and other things you could eat along with it and it was filling. The two dishes we got were perfect for sharing and surprisingly filling. \n\nOverall, good service and food. The price is on the costly side but the aesthetics of the cafe and the entire building itself is worth it.

It was a total rip off for only a 10-15 minute party bus ride.  The bus had free drinks but it was premixed Cuervo/canned beer and the ride was so short we only had time to down one or two drinks before it was over.\n\nLiquid at the Aria charged extra for chairs and wouldn't let us even put our sandals or purses down on the ground.

Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.\n\nThe lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.\n\nAll the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).\n\nI wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado.

Hiring this company ensures you can enjoy paint chips and debris everywhere, paint over-sprays on everything, drips in your plants and lawn (not to mention the plants trampled and crushed by ladders and careless boots) and paint stains on any concrete or paved surface . The job will no doubt take at least double the time frame promised and the crew will certainly enjoy using your front lawn and patio for their \"lunch breaks\" which can run from 10am - noon and be complete with food trash, crumbs, cigarette butts and a radio so all your neighbors can enjoy the sounds of Spanish music mixed with 3-5 loud Spanish speaking men who have no idea how to paint a home. (These are unsupervised hooligans after all) You can have them do bad stucco work as well! This is a full-service horrible company. You can speak daily with the \"manager\" who will smile to your face and then ignore your concerns, never writing anything down so it can be \"checked-up on\" after completion. He will never be on the job site to supervise the crew either, but I'm sure calling his cell phone will make you feel better as you see things being done incorrectly. You can even speak with the owner, a well-spoken \"business man\" whose \"professional company\" is happy to not properly do any of the job you're paying for. You will get a hearty apology and several assurances that \"this never happens\" and \"we hope you know the kind of person I am\" as if this is going to help remedy their poor performance by keeping in mind that the owner is a really great guy if you just get to know him.

Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.\n\nI sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.\n\n  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.\n\nWithin another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.\n\n\nWe get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.\n\n  Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can \"get it whenever we're ready\", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    \n\n  At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    \n\n\n The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.         \n\n\n   I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.  \n\n\nI'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.

Last night at 7:30 pm (5/6/13) my battery died yet again in my car. I purchased it from O'Reilly about 3 years ago an had it replaced about 14 months ago with a new battery from O'Reilly's. I took it out of my car and brought it in, expecting to have a quick check on the battery and replaced like it's always been.   To my dismay the employee said he needed to attempt to charge the faulty battery for 30 minutes while I waited in the store. I complained that this was never done ever in the past and he stated this is always how it was done.   Since the employee did not value my time over his, I was forced to wait while they attempted to charge my faulty battery. After 30 minutes he checked the battery again...and determined it was indeed faulty. He grabbed a new battery from the shelve and informed me it would be $55... I complained that the last battery did not last the 24 months and it was under replacement.   The employee informed me that the warranty was from the original date of purchase and prorated afterward. After explaining that he wasted over a half of hour of my time and other retailers such as Costco allow the warranty period to restart when you get a new replacement...he didn't seem to care. He actually told me, \"well you should of bought it at Costco then\".   At that point I took my old battery back and left the store. For a company that prides itself on customer service...I could not of been found at that store that night. I ended up purchasing a new battery at Costco. Even though it cost me more upfront, I consider it a learning experience. The employee's at that branch were not interested in service, only sales.

The Stacked Burger I ordered was great along with the redskin fries.

Also in my opinion the burger should have been on a different plate as the width of the plate was too short and when I ate the burger the toppings were falling off the plate.

But other than that I can't say the rest of my experience was as great as she was.  I went here for the first time because I needed some hair supplies and my hair dryer broke on me and I was in a rush to get a replacement.  I've heard of Sally's before so I decided I'd check it out.  I came to this particular location and found everything I was looking for including my hair dryer.  The day after, I went back to get an exchange for a hair razor because I purchased the wrong one.  No problem there, as it was a straight exchange.  A couple of days later, I tried to use my NEW hair dryer and it broke down after 2 uses... It was no longer blowing hot air.  WTF.. So I made a second trip to go exchange it for another one.  I exchanged a hair dryer that was cheaper than the original one I purchased and I was supposed to get a REFUND on the remaining balance, but instead the girl did a PURCHASE and charged me for the difference.  I didn't realize this until my bill came in the mail saying I did purchase rather than a return.  Annoyed, I went to the store a couple weeks later with my credit card bill asking to speak to the manager on duty about this.  Stephanie, the supervisor on duty, called her manager right away and took down my information, informing me that the manager would call me the following Monday when she was in.  Monday rolled around and I never received a call, I called on Tuesday and the girl told me that she never came in for her shift and that she'd pass along the message to call me back asap.  A week later, no call.  At this point, I'm irritated and angry with the horrible customer service, especially from the manager.  I went straight to Head Office and called them to inform them of the issue and what was going on.  The process of having to refund my money onto my credit card should not take over a month!  I spoke to a representative from Head Office and she said she would have to speak to the store and look further into the situation and she'd call me back.  A couple more days pass by, no call.  I decided I'd call Head Office AGAIN.  I spoke to a representative and she said that the manager was dealing with another customer and she would get her to call me back as soon as she was done instead of putting me on hold.  I was very stern and straight forward informing her that I would be really upset if she doesn't call back and she insisted she would let her manager know before she leaves for the day.  Never received a call within the next 15 minutes. I called back again, and got another representative  and told her that the manager on duty was supposed to call me back.  She went to go look for the manager and she had already left for the day!  At that point, I was livid and I expressed how I felt to the representative I was currently speaking to and she was EXTREMELY RUDE and interrupted me as I was speaking!  She even responded with \"Do you want a solution to this?..... Fant-astic!\" (In the most sarcastic voice ever).  She asked me to call my bank to ask them to reverse the charges and to let them know I didn't approve of it.  So basically after waiting a month to get this sorted out, she wanted me to solve it on my own.  How f'ed up is that?  The next day - of course, I receive a call from the store and from Head Office again.  Both of them left a voicemail stating that they would do the refund without any issues as long as I go into the store to do it..  SERIOUSLY?  I have to make another trip to the store to do a refund??  I called Stephanie to ask her if we could do the refund over the phone and she asked her manager and the manager said no because they needed my physical card to do the refund.   So now this was going to be my fourth trip to the store.. and that will be the last time I go back to the store, PERIOD.

Unfortunately, it is quite far from where I live so I've only been there once. Free lot parking.\n\nAmbiance:\nYou can tell post-docs and professors go here based on the caliber of conversation (that may include criticizing students for being whiny). I find it pleasant, and generally pretty quiet. When I went in late August, there were ample tables, black chairs and gray carpet. Overall, it was a bit drab and dim for a Thai place. They also seem to have a mini stage which makes me wonder if this place offers, or its prior owners, offered karaoke. The lighting was a little dim for my taste too, but it is okay. It's decent for a romantic date.\n\nFood:\n- It's rare to screw up thai iced tea so well-done.\n- I ordered the peanut egg foo young because it was such a unique concept. It is not the most favorite thing I have had in my life because I overdosed on the Thai peanut sauce. Think about it: two thick, juicy omelettes, soaked in super sweet thai peanut sauce.

I like the fresh sprouts that they use and the noodles are always delicious.\n\nTomato onion scallops: yuck! I love scallops and decided to order this for the first time. There was so much sweet and sour dressing on it, it was like drinking that thing. Ugh... I expected it to be fried scallops with fresh tomatoes and onions, but i guess I was wrong on this dish.

Bell managed, the office staff was super friendly and I felt it was worth the price. Now that Escape is under new management, I can't say the same. The grounds used to be clean and office staff was friendly. I transferred from a one bedroom apartment to a two bedroom within the community a year ago. Upon inspection, the maintenance crew told me I would not be charged. The carpet was pulled up and frayed near a bedroom door and one wall had two large holes from a TV wall mount. Even still, I was told it was fine and that the carpet would have to be replaced anyway and touch ups are done before new residents move in. In the present, my lease just ended and an inspection had to be done by the new management crew. First off, Brenden was extremely rude to me while doing the inspection. He told me it was not normal wear and tear and would be at least 200 dollars to patch up the carpet. The \"damages\" in the second apartment are not as bad as the first. The only reason I did not fix the TV holes on wall and rug, is because I was not charged last time. Every time I tried to reason with Brandon he raised his voice at me and said there is no use talking to me I don't get it. I recently spoke to the manager Chris Carrol and it was as if I was speaking to Brendens twin. He even tried to charge me 55 for the touch up paint for the two holes on wall when Brenden said it would only be 20. He also stated that they are good friends outside of work and said that I shouldn't have made smart alec comments to Brenden. Overall, this has been a nightmare.

We made a last minute reservation to La Raclette to finally try raclette and after our experience here, were so happy we did. We were warmly greeted by our host, and seated by a window, which we had requested. Our waiter was extremely welcoming and explained how the menu worked. After receiving some delicious French bread and a jar of small cornichon pickles, we ordered the raclette for two, and a kid's fondue meal for our child, who was very excited to have gazpacho with it as well.\nThe German Beer soup I got as an appetizer was delicious and a heartier version of French Onion soup.\nMy husband had the scallop app, which was a thinly sliced raw carpaccio, very fresh and mild tasting.\nFor the main course, we were presented with a burner box and small square tray for melting the cheese. On top of the box were two small square dishes containing quartered boiled potatoes in one dish and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus pieces, as well as a large plate of the cheese slices, thinly sliced ham, salami, dried prosciutto and a serving of a lovely green salad with thinly sliced beets on it.\nMy son received a smaller version of their fondue and it was perfect for him (as well as us to sample). He too received a dish with salad, some ham and veggies to dip and a basket of bread pieces as well.\nWe had so much fun melting our cheese and figuring out different combinations to eat our melted cheese with, and both meals were outstanding. Since we brought our own wine as well, it was even more enjoyable. The service was also excellent and attentive, with our water cups being refilled quickly (such rich food makes one thirsty, after all!).\nFinally for dessert I ordered the Chocolate Dome which was presented with flair and melted for us by our waiter with warm butterscotch. Inside the dome was ice cream, small cubes of pound cake and fresh berries on the perimeter. It was like a chocolate fondue without the pot!\nThis had to be the best dining experience we have had in Montreal so far and beyond the excellent food, we had such a wonderful experience visiting this outstanding place!

Usually I hate going to ramen restaurants due to the long lineup and the food not living up to the hype, but Koi is definitely a ramen restaurant that I will for sure to revisit and recommend. \n\nEnvironment:\nThe plaza is pretty easy to find and get to if you drive a car. But then again, it is super inconvenient to get anywhere if you don't own a car in Markham/Richmond Hill. There are plenty of parking at the plaza, however, it seems that there are more cars now due to the new hot pot place that recently opened, but there are still loads of parking space at the back. \nThe restaurant itself is pretty small though, best for a casual dine-out for groups of 4 and under. \n\nFood:\nSince this is a ramen restaurant it's no brainer that you must try their ramen dishes. Me and my friend both decided to order the Hokkaido Ramen (about $10) plus a Deep Fried Pork Cutlet (about $5) on the side, just in case there wasn't enough toppings in the ramen. The ramen ended up being really filling though, and for the toppings there was 1 egg, 2 slices of bbq pork, 1 small slice of fish ball, some corn, black fungus, green onion, and a strip of seaweed in the bowl. The soup was really nice and creamy, and it was relieving to see that there was no MSG in it since I didn't get super thirsty after the meal. The Pork Cutlet wasn't that good in my opinion and the batter is a little too thick. If you feel that you won't be full from the ramen you should just add extra pork to the noodle as opposed to order side dishes.  \nThey also have tofu cheesecake for $4 a slice, but I was already too full after my meal to give it a try. The alcohol menu was pretty large as well and they have some other interesting Japanese beverages.\n\nService:\nThe service was actually pretty good.

This place previously only serves Soups and one medium soup that comes with two sides (bread, veggies or fruits) will cost you around $10.  Their NEW Wrap/Sandwich Combo with a combo size soup (one size smaller than small) is also around $10 and you can always upsize the soup to the next size for $1 per size higher.

I booked through Orbitz and used a coupon that I found on another site and I managed to get a roundtrip ticket from New York to Toronto plus 4 nights at this hotel for the inclusive price of $400.  I've never paid less than $250 for a plane ticket to Toronto (and that was in the dead of winter--I traveled in the summer) so 150 divided by 4 is just less than $40 per night.  And that is only IF the plane ticket was $250.  Before writing this review, I did a search on this hotel to see what the prices are now and it's around $250 per night.  Now tell me I didn't get the deal of a lifetime.\n\nThis hotel is located downtown in a great area within walking distance to the Theatre District, Nightclub District and the many great restaurants that line King St. West.  You will find that you're amongst the finer boutique hotels.\n\nThe staff are extremely friendly and service is always given with a smile.  If you need anything, they'll attend to it right away.  The rooms are like corporate apartments with full kitchens.  I love having a kitchen in my hotel room.  Most of the time I don't use it, but this time I did.  I cooked all week and still managed to dine out every day.  It was good for my late night cravings.\n\nMy room had a king-size bed, living room area with (I believe) a sofabed, computer desk, dinette set and, surprisingly, cool decor.  The bed was amazingly comfortable and the linens weren't cheap.  The wireless internet was fast and FREE!  And there was a free breakfast buffet in the morning.  Talk about value!\n\nIf I had to pay $250/night for this place, I could probably justify it but I'm a bargain hunter and would rather pay $250/night for a $500/night hotel.

We were originally guna spend the night at The Rail (but tho my friends called in advance for a reservation, were told not necessary, but yet when we arrived there were no tables) so after a call to Robbie's (which was also booked solid) we called Maddie's and got reservations for 8 ppl at 6:30pm on a Saturday night (week before Christmas). We were seated quickly but several other tables arrived almost simultaneously and we were asked to wait very respectfully by our awesome waiter Eric several times before our orders were actually taken (we didn't mind we were enjoying each other's company). The fun thing about Maddies is 1- you get to go pick ur own bottle of wine (which are of above-average prices) and 2- if you're a smoker: u get to smoke indoors. So getting on with it, service my gawd: amazing !! Last time me and t friends were served by Jeff (we loved Jeff he was a super awesome waiter no longer there -- if u know where he's gone please message me 'cuz we will go there!) This time we had Eric who was fantastic and soooooo charming! (And handsome ;) ) What an excellent waiter: he did awesome considering he was dealing with a staff, restaurant and stock that had had an unexpected surplus of clientele the previous night that had all but obliterated the quantity available of wines and foods making his job as a waiter most precarious. He didn't charge us for most of our sides and bought us a round of shots at the end, in return we tipped him quite merry Christmas generously but he did well in what he did because had it not been for him this place would have easily scored 2 stars tonight and we likely would never re-consider it for future outings despite having greatly enjoyed our last visit because of their lack of staff and lack of supplies making this visit so close to disastrous it was ONLY SAVED BY OUR WAITER- I cannot emphasize that enough. I had the Rib Roast beef, i ordered medium rare, it was a tad more on the rare side but i didn't complain because it was still phenomenal. Most of my friends who ordered beef of some cut had the same problem slightly more rare than medium rare, slightly more medium rare than medium but we all still enjoyed our plates.

Clarke's opened tonight in the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  Our regular Friday Night gang met there last night for the last of their \"soft openings.\"  In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was comped, and was mostly limited to the evening's featured \"softie\" - burgers.  I say mostly, because when we got there, late, victims of the traffic that engulfed the Strip due to the influx of CES tourists, our friends were already gorging on a plate of raw oysters, and that wasn't on the list we were given.   We, too, were coming from the Convention center, and it took us 45 minutes to get to Caesar's, then another 10 to get the car valet'd, since that, too, was full.\n\nHubster and I don't eat oysters, so our friends managed to convince them to bring us shrimp.  And gawd, those were the biggest damned shrimp I've ever seen.  They were terrific.\n\nThe real freebie consisted of wine or beer, burgers, fries, and salad.  We're white wine drinkers, and there was no Riesling, just Chardonnay and Pino Grigio.  The Pino was super dry, so I had some Merlot.  The salad was one big disappointment, just a pile of ugly greens with a few thin slices of the tiniest baby radish I ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won't get you anything else, not even a crouton.\n\nThe burgers were great - fresh, meaty, not oversalted - but the buns were just ordinary.  I ordered mine with Vermont cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms.  Toppings are $1.20 each, so that brought the burger close to $14, which I guess is par for the Strip, which is why we stick mostly local.  I also ordered a cup of coffee, and it was cold.\n\nWhat really drowned this place for us, though, was the water, pun intended.  The waiter asked whether we all wanted water.  I said \"no,\" but got it anyway.  It was served in small glasses slightly larger than juice glasses, with no logo.  There was no brand to approve, no cork to sniff, no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when we got the pretend bill, we noticed that THEY CHARGED FOR THE WATER!!!  What the hell are they thinking???  Has Lake Mead become a designer label??  And that, dear reader, is my death knell for this restaurant.\n\nThe service was spotty.  The place wasn't more than one-third full, yet our waiter had some trouble keeping up and getting things right.  Service picked up tremendously when Marty, who said he was a busser, joined the team.  A young and earnest full-time Type A, he went over and above to see that we were satisfied.  He was definitely worth the price of admission.\n\nP.J. Clarke's is a venerable New York institution, in business since 1884, and that's no typo.  They're suddenly pushing to go national - they have a branch in Chicago, one that just opened in D.C., and now, Vegas.  I tried to check the website to see what the full menu is like, but the links on the Vegas page aren't working, at least on Firefox and Chrome.  (I don't go near IE).  IMHO, this is symbolic of the lengths they'll need to travel to distinguish themselves from all the competition in this town.

Wrong. \n\nAfter travelling roughly a year to go from Calgary's NW to the deep, deep south and questioning many times if I was even still in Calgary anymore (shockingly I was), I met up with some friends to watch a Flames game here. I've been to Brewsters several times up north (Crowfoot Location) and to be honest the service has always been underwhelming. So has the food. In fact, if I wasn't a beer drinker who also likes antioxidants (they've got a killer blueberry beer here) I'd probably never go out of my way to get to a Brewsters.\n\nBut this location won me over with a combination of super friendly staff and a kitchen that seems to actually kind-of, sort-of give a damn whether your meal sucks or not. \n\nThe place was packed, so myself and four friends lined the bar where we could see the game. Lots of screens, so this wasn't too hard.\n\nThe bartender took care of us immediately, shooting us menus and pouring drinks like we had raging infernos in our throats that could only be doused out by delicious beer. After spending a few periods here watching the game we were treated to a beer fusion - the bartender poured us all shots of a Huckleberry/Raspberry beer combo. Now, while I'm sure giving us these tiny beers was just a marketing tactic to make us buy more big beers, it WORKED. As soon as that magical Huck/Rasp elixir hit my lips I needed more of it in my life.\n\nAnd that's something they don't really tell you at Brewsters - you can COMBINE the beers. They should really list that on the menu somewhere - my frankenbeer was amazing.\n\nI ordered a burger. Normally the burgers I've been served at Brewsters have been sloppily put together and pretty greasy. Not so in the magical land of McKenzie Towne.

This review is LONG overdue - during the last year or so working downtown has given me multiple chances to eat at the beloved Bluebird Kitchen. I've come here for made-to-order breakfasts and lunches alike, and nothing has disappointed. \n\nTheir enormous breakfast sandwiches and fresh fruit smoothies leave me feeling full and satisfied, moreso than other places with similar breakfast options; the potato, sausage, egg and goat cheese laden frittata sandwich is a definite favorite. And their lunches are also a wonderful and tasty option should I forget to bring something to work that day. Their roast beef and Cuban sandwiches have been my favorites so far.\n\nIf you're the type who likes seasonal items, Bluebird offers monthly smoothies and sandwiches as an addition to the standard menu. I tried their special vegetarian sandwich from last summer (with fried green tomato, grapefruit & cabbage coleslaw) - I admittedly remember that sandwich being on the bitter side, more so than I expected as someone who likes both green tomatoes and grapefruit. It wasn't bad though, and it was certainly a unique flavor profile compared to what I typically find for a quicker downtown lunchtime option.\n\nIt's definitely safe to say that this place has knocked it out of the park and made my taste buds very happy time and time again. And that's just considering their main meals - the amazing desserts elevate your meal options to an entirely different level. They're good. They're really good.

However, the secret already is because this small place gets pretty crowded from 11:30 until 1:00 later in the week. I always get my order to go because the space is just too tight for me. It's about the size of a small Subway with some stools at the bar. Some of the tables are close to the drink machine and that also happens to be where the line forms to order so that can get uncomfortable quickly. It's not really in a gas station but there is a gas station next door that has a Subway inside of it. It is in the same strip mall as that station and there is also a dry cleaners in the building.\n\nThe trick is to go after 1:00 or go earlier in the week. They are only open until 5, so dinner is not an option for most people. They have a \"Speedy Gonzalez\" special that is designed to be quick and cheap. For $5.25, you get a taco, and enchilada, beans, rice, and some tortilla chips. I always get the burrito though. It's $6.25 and also comes with beans, rice, and chips. I once tried to get it with spinach but that was not good. It was just microwaved creamed spinach. They have a large variety on the menu but lack the vegetables that some of the chain \"Mexican\" places offer. Some items take longer to prepare such as steak, so if you are in a hurry or they are busy, they will let you know that (the woman that is always working the counter when I go is very nice).\n\nThis is a good place to get some mostly authentic-style Mexican food cheap, without having to do a sit-down at a place like Azteca.

My girlfriend prefers their strawberry French toast, which I've never really been all too impressed with - as it's basically just the addition of some strawberry cream cheese.\n\nWe usually don't go to breakfast during busy hours, but prefer visiting in the early afternoon to avoid the crowds.

The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  \n\nHis response to me was \"You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind\".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  \n\nSo, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  \n\nI will never again do a food delivery at this location.

Much to my surprise, we received a text about 15 minutes later and were taken to a table that had been open the entire time we were sitting in the lobby area. \n\nOh well, next...it took a bit for the server to come to our table, a little longer to take the order, even longer to get our food...we spent a lot of time waiting. In our sever's defense - you could see that she had a ton of tables and was working really hard. I was totally disappointed to learn that they no longer had the Monte Cristo sandwich and got a club (very average) and chicken tenders (kind of weird/artificial tasting). The chicken tenders come with a chipotle dipping sauce that was kind of tasty. We finished our meal, paid without being offered a desert menu ($12-$15) and then ventured into the attached gift shop/candy store and decided against buying our daughter an $89 Hello Kitty backpack (it just seemed a bit overpriced). Plus the music was so loud, I am not sure that my tympanic membrane could handle another minute of it.

Also we got into our room and our TV wasn't working, if i wasn't technically proficient and figured out how to get the signal from the cable box to the TV then I wouldn't have been able to watch TV in the room, as when I turned it on all I had was static, something that the person prepping the room should have checked. Inexcusable lack of detail.\n\nElevator : There is only one elevator in the building, so if its busy and you have alot of people staying then you could be waiting quite some time to get back to your floor unless you want to take the stairs.\n\n\nSo there you go, weigh up the pros and cons for your visit, if it were me I may look into one of the other options in the area, but if you're not sharing a room with your hairy buddy then maybe it might be a good option.", "date": "2016-11-21 20:19:08"}, {"review_id": "iZp_Djui3GMTeDhEdV28vg", "user_id": "445KFUr5BnlTa5MZdZUR1g", "business_id": "eQfYZrSuzE6B4vkmu74H6w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Where else can you see pouters, pet a wallaby and eat roasted corn?

I had been told that the portions were small so we ordered 6 tacos a person for 3 people. FYI unless you are a glutton the portions are lovely. We definitely over ordered. The guacamole was fresh and bright and delicious. I could definitely taste (and feel) the liquor in the drinks. The server was on point and had plenty of help. The food took close to an hour.

Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. \n\n#2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. \n\n#3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. \n\nMy review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. \n\n* Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. \n\n* The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. \n\n* OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. \n\n\n\nIt is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. \n*Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. \n* Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around.

My husband ordered the blackened halibut, I took at bite and the fish was very dry and burned around the edges.  I tasted the carrots and the they were not cooked all the way, they were still hard.  The baked potato was the size of a roma tomato and it was also dry.  What a waste of time and money.  I spoke with Marie the manager and she came across as not caring and let me know that my steak was removed from my bill.  I would have been very upset had she charged me for a meal I did not eat. She didn't do anything to have me want to come back.

There are antique and gift shops, historic homes and a choice of interesting places to eat.\n\nOwned by chef Justin Piazza, La Piazza is all about comfort Italian. The menu might be small but it packs a wallop, offering a range of pizzas, pasta and a handful of salads. I went hog wild because there were so many things that I wanted to try, and at their low prices I indulged.\n\nMight as well start with something light, like the Spinach Salad ($8), which is covered in a warm bacon vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The spinach was super fresh, showing the commitment to the best and newly picked ingredients. Considering the meager cost of this huge salad shared by two hefty eaters there is some serious value to be had here.\n\nAntipasti offerings are kept simple, with only a handful of choices, but one caught my eye. I was elated with each bite of Fried Ravioli ($8.50). Breaking through the crispy pasta revealed an inside filled with a molten cheesy heaven. This come with a side of tomato sauce for dipping and once you get started with these bad boys, it's hard to stop.\n\nBased on the name alone, anything called Spaghetti Pie ($9) is worth ordering. So I was tickled when the massive slab of baked spaghetti resembling a brick was set onto the table. Spaghetti was layered with cheese and finished with a tomato sauce cream sauce that was so satisfying. The spaghetti pie was a daily special, but from other visits it's pretty normal to see it featured.\n\nTheir pizzas are baked in a wood-burning oven. Preparation takes only a few minutes and the intense heat slightly chars and crisps the pizzas. The Italian Stallion ($16), in all of its meaty goodness, is covered with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto and sopressata. For some, all of this meat might sound excessive, but the distribution and amount create a balance of cheese, meat and crust, making each chewy bite a pleasure.\n\nGuy Fieri has taste you can trust, proving himself once again with La Piazza al Forno. During peak dinner hours there will be a line out the door. If you want to avoid this, go for lunch the odds are you'll be seated right away.", "date": "2010-01-08 02:28:35"}, {"review_id": "KFLN7mJ2-ksQhc-sJU2ntg", "user_id": "vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ", "business_id": "_EBa6I5KkADiCdcBHOC_tg", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "At the recommendation of a coworker, I stopped by Daily Kitchen to get lunch one day last week. The parking lot was packed, but upon arrival there weren't many other people in the restaurant. One gentleman ahead of me in line, but it looked like everyone else already had their food. \n\nI ordered the regular DK burger with no onions, which comes with a side of sweet potato fries, and I ordered a lemonade. The lady who took my order was really friendly! So I got my rosemary vanilla lemonade (which was delicious!! A little on the sweet tasting side, but it was still really good) and sat down to wait for my order. A group of people came in after me from the nearby hospital/urgent care, and suddenly it was waaaay busy. I guess that's why I ended up waiting 25 minutes for a burger & fries. 25 minutes. For a to go order. Too long. At lunch time, I'd expect there to be a rush, so I'd staff enough people to handle it. They didn't seem like they had enough people to handle the rush. \n\nSo anyway, after 25 minutes, I finally get my food, refill my lemonade and head back to the office.

We saw that they had papaya salad so we were excited to give that a try since you don't see that at a lot of Thai restaurants anymore nowadays. We also got yellow curry chicken, since you can never go wrong with that! ....but we were wrong ): The curry was EXTREMELY sweet and watery, chicken was rubbery and rice was dry and not Jasmine-y. The papaya salad had a bed of lettuce on the bottom, which was so strange to me. At least they used real papaya but it was also sweet and not as flavorful as I would have liked. Usually in papaya salad you can smell/taste the different flavors like garlic, fish sauce, slight sweetness from the palm sugar and sourness from the fresh lime. The Thai tea was not too bad, you can tell it's real tea, just very creamy from all the cream they put on top.

Most of the dishes have a unique ingredient that gives it a new twist, without taking over the traditional base.  My favorite dish by far here is the Baja Ceviche.  It inspires me to make my own ceviche at home every time i have it.   A delicate blend of fish, shrimp, red onions, tomato, avocado and a fresh cilantro sauce drizzled over.   \n\nMy other favorites from prior visits are the empanadas and the sweet green mini tamales.  Last night I had the chicken poblano enchiladas.  Let me say I have been craving green enchiladas for about 6 months.  I loved the chicken filling and loved the addition of thinly sliced portobello mushrooms, corn, nopal and poblano on top,  BUT there was WAY too much Green sauce, drowning some of the awesome flavors.  Would have been much better with a drizzling of the green sauce and the addition of some melted white cheese.  After all it can't be great enchiladas without lots of cheese.   \n\nMy husband had the carnitas,  which were delicious.  Again unique ingredients added a twist,  bacon, citrus and a bed of polenta underneath.  His flour tortilla was the yummy authentic type.  \n\nMy other favorite last night was the CABO RITA, mmmmmm,  pear puree in a  margarita made with fresh lime juice and agave,  versus sweet and sour and triple sec.   One of the best margaritas I've ever had.  \n\nSadly the service SUCKED.  Our waitress never once came to check on us.  We had to wave her,  or the busboy down every time we needed something.  It even took 20 minutes just to get and process the check and we had to ask 3 times to move it along.   Also, sadly, when we made the reservation, they promised a pool view booth which was not available when we got there.  there was a front pool view table, which we said we would take, but it was \"reserved\"  to make a big table for a future reservation.   When we left, it was occupied by another couple, not  a big table.   Being lied to doesn't make the guest feel appreciated. \n\nHad it not been for the service and the over abundance of green sauce, and the slight overprices,  I would rate 5 stars. The awesomeness of the Ceviche and the Margarita, raise it from 3 stars to 4.  \n\nIf you like unique tastes,  I would still recommend.   \n\nThe night was capped beautifully by a fun shopping excursion at my stores, Misura, Paradiso and Ruby Blue near the valet entrance!", "date": "2012-04-28 16:35:48"}, {"review_id": "PEHzn4869na_zAfR_BOHig", "user_id": "YroA2CgApVM33sXNleRC_w", "business_id": "1QJFpZxLbHbXSKohWp9uIA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "First time in, went for lunch and had a short wait that was more than worth it.. the service was great and the food was better than I expected.

We asked about the market price on one of the special crab, the answer was, \"I don't know what the price is... plus we don't have it anymore anyway\".  10 minutes later.. saw another table that came after us ordered a bunch of those crab.  Asked for a Sapporo, never came, finally came, but a different kind of beer, and said they don't have Sapporo or most of the beer on the menu.  One main dish (cajun clam) came out when we were about to finish the whole meal.  \n\nFood: Shrimp are big...but tough texture and seemed very overcooked. Plus their items (shrimp, clams) didn't come in a bag like HnJ, so flavors aren't mixed and steamed together.  Corn and potatoes are on a separate plate with 0 flavor.  And the corn was cold in the middle like some other reviewers were saying.  \n\nOverall, we came in with an open mind and walked away disappointed.  We want this place to be good and do well, but they didn't deliver.

I received my first tattoo from Rick Godsey a few years ago when he was at a different shop and I loved it. Rick listens to what you want, asks questions, puts his spin on it and then gets your approval on it before putting it on your body. He's also very good at putting you to ease by talking to you when you're getting your art done.  I've been very happy with his work and he has done beautiful work on one of my friends as well. \n\nThe 3 stars is for the shop itself, like I said it's in the same building as a gas station and it's very tiny. The rooms you get your tattoo in are rather large and comfortable but the area where you come in is tiny and there's really nowhere to go if there are people there.

While I'd love to eat nothing but delicate cuts of sashimi and simple, well-crafted nigiri, my wallet dictates that I feast on rolls if I want a satisfying meal without spending a fortune. And I have no problem eating crazy, sauce-covered rolls that would horrify most Japanese and drive them to seppuku. \n\nMy tastes are Americanized, afterall, so rolls are cool with me. Their specialty rolls are half price all day, every day. But, if you use a restaurant.com gift card like I did on my first visit you have to pay full-price for the rolls.\n\nThe rolls we've tried have all tasted good -- the Bonzai, Red Dragon, Spicy tuna crunch, Hawaiian, and Yellowtail cover rolls. But, are sometimes sloppily assembled. Having ordered some of the rolls twice, we noticed that they don't always come out the same. QA issues aside, I can't really complain because the food is relatively inexpensive.\n\nThe yellowtail with jalape\u00f1o ($13) was also solid. We ordered tuna sashimi ($12) but what they brought out was seared tuna with a bunch of crispy stuff on top. We tried telling the waitress it was wrong but she insisted that that was how they do it there. Right... I guess that's what they tell all the non-Asian looking folk. \n\nThat brings me to my biggest gripe about this place -- the service. They're friendly, but slow. If you want a quick meal this is the last place you should go. Expect a long wait to have your order taken and even more time to go by before you get your food. If you want refills, think again. Even if the place is empty, which it was on both of our visits, you'll spend a good hour and a half or more eating there.\n\nAt least the place is comfy. The interior is quite spacious and they have a few large TVs scattered around in addition to a projection screen and a stage where there is occasionally live music. Large booths are scattered around the room, making your wait time somewhat more enjoyable.\n\nDespite its flaws, it's a good place to get some rolls at a decent price if you're not in a hurry.\n\n3.5 Stars", "date": "2012-02-01 08:16:37"}, {"review_id": "62-lq-DXY3tTNhllPL5psg", "user_id": "ftO5AlqZ06EwmjqBYkF5Nw", "business_id": "L41laSjfQqW3f3pyKdBxNw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We had our blind Maltese groomed on the weekend by Fetching Fido.

I LOVE Mexican and I wanted to like this restaurant so much because I thought I found a 'hidden jem' near our new house + all the reviews were so good, but...yikes.\n\nPersonally, I would think of this restaurant as more of a trendy take on Mexican.  Sort of Mad-Mexish maybe? But not exactly. I am normally not a person to salt my food, but I felt like just about EVERYTHING needed salt and/or was very bland.  It started with the salsa, then the guac, the pico then the rice and beans.  I mean TOTALLY BLAND.  I even got a pineapple margarita lacked flavor.  I thought there was something wrong with me but my friend I was eating with confirmed it. \n\nThe salsa was brown and I'd guess was roasted tomato flavor?  I can appreciate a non-traditional salsa, but I dind't taste any seasonings and it didn't have a citric taste like any tomato salsa would normally have.  Next we ordered the tableside guacamole. We are guac finatics, but the pico they added had no citrus zing and it needed salt. They made it tableside, but it was already all in the bowl when she brought it and she just mashed it at the table.  \n\nThe pineapple margarita seemed to be made with fresh pineapple juice, which is awesome.  I ordered it blended and it was very watered down. but I dind't think $8 for an Avion margarita was that bad. \n\nI had the surf n turf burrito which was loaded with delicious tender steak and big shrimp, both cooked very well.  It was topped with a creamy orange colored sauce that was very tasty...but then they stuffed it with rice that had NO flavor. It looked redish orange, but had literally ZERO flavor. I had to ask the waitress for a salt shaker to even be able to eat it, but it barley helped. \n\nMy friend had the grilled mahi mahi tacos which she said were really good.  But she had the same opinion on the rice. It also came with black beans that tasted like boiled, rinsed, dry black beans. No seasonings that we could detect. \n\nIn fairness to the restaurant, I did not complain.  When this many things are wrong, you just kind of assume that this is how they make their food and that we just wont go back.

I suppose that means that the times I do attend a concert are just extra special these days. This review is based on my CPO concert-going experience spanning 16 years, with some specifics on the last two concerts I attended.\n\nThe CPO is truly one of the top orchestras in the country. The group has come a long way since its inception in 1955. Like all world-class orchestras, they offer the staples of concert series: Baroque (the Serenade Series), Classical and Pops. In more recent history, they have added a new music festival, a Tchaikovsky Festival and crowd-pleasing specials like Jeans &  Classics, Video Games Live, Bugs Bunny on Broadway and Star Trek. Their Saturday Morning at the Symphony Series is also quite popular.\n\nI attended the Video Games Live 2.0 concert and one of the New Works performances in May. Their website provides a lot of information to help you make your purchase. The Box Office is extremely friendly, efficient and helpful when you need to contact them with a question or group ticket purchase.\n\nThe VGL 2.0 concert experience was a blast! They had gaming stations in the lobby, a costume contest, CD's, t-shirts, giveaways, and the Nintendo people were there. Even the Blindfolded Pianist of Youtube fame made an appearance. It was a huge celebration of gaming. Members of the audience came up to play Space Invaders and Guitar Hero. The orchestra played the music to match the players' progress (or lack thereof). \n\nIn contrast, the New Works concert was a celebration of our Canadian composers. This was held at the Rozsa Centre. The group looked crowded on stage, but it somehow worked. I loved how the newest cellist waded his way to the front of the stage to make some opening remarks. There are a lot of new, fresh faces in the orchestra and they are giving the CPO a cool, hip vibe. \n\nThat's a good thing. Yes, the orchestra needs to sound good, but to attract younger audiences, they also need to exude a bit of that \"coolness factor\", whether they're playing Bach, Brahms, Alan Gordon Bell or Bugs Bunny.\n\nThe artists came out to talk after each performance as well.\n\nThose Hagen-Daaz bars are a great treat too.\n\nVenues are top notch. The Jack Singer Concert Hall has wonderful acoustics. If you're going for sound, there isn't a bad seat in the house. If you want a good view, some seats are better than others. There is a good range of tickets, from dirt cheap to top of the line to meet any budget.\n\nSeating is really good at the Rozsa Centre. It's a smaller facility but everything sounds and looks good in there. It's got a more intimate feel to it as well.\n\nAs for the \"front of house\" environment, they've recently made some updates in the lobby that make traffic flow smoother, but that's the EPCOR Centre's domain so I won't go more into that.\n\nIt's really cool that they have orchestra members interacting more with the public with things like SMATS, opening addresses and the Ask a Musician section on their website.\n\nBerthold Auerbach once said that \"Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.\" Does the CPO deliver on this? Yes they do. They are a dedicated bunch and they play \"con molto espressione\".\n\n[EDIT: To be absolutely honest, I worked @ CPO a very long time ago. It's been over 12 years ago and I don't know anyone there anymore so I trust that it's safe to review without any conflicts.]", "date": "2009-10-13 08:30:55"}, {"review_id": "mkPvnPXW70fZXDE8cwP72A", "user_id": "teXLmGR-kiEEVW93TCe32w", "business_id": "ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I came here during my Vegas trip and thoroughly enjoyed myself.

Little did I know, it was actually a food & wine pairing, which I had never done before. Needless to say I was excited, considering how much I love both of those things!\n\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous, but that goes without saying. Situated in the middle of Prince's Island Park, you can either park near the Eau Claire shopping centre, or across Memorial in the lot. Our reservation was for 5pm, so the sun was still shining through the big, open windows and the breeze flowed through beautifully. The decor is simple, yet classy and feels upscale but not pretentious. The overall feeling is warm & cozy, as evidenced by the beautiful throw blankets set aside for guests who get chilly. Love it already!\n\nOnce we arrived we were tended to by a wonderful server. I missed his name but he was fabulous - and 10 steps ahead of all of us. When someone dropped a napkin, he was there to pick it up before you even realized it fell. When you ran out of water, he was topping it up before you had the chance to ask. He was extremely polite, friendly, and knowledgeable about everything we were being served. He informed us that we would be going through 9 courses, so thank goodness I was starving! We ordered cocktails to start, I had the River Ice and it was fabulous! Light & refreshing and exactly what I was looking for.\n\nI know I won't remember any of the wines we were paired, all I know is that I had never given it much thought until this meal. The way the wine complimented every flavor in each dish was exquisite! We started with a soup - pureed vegetables with fresh cream and a piece of prosciutto on top. It was very tasty, albeit not as hot as I would prefer. Our next course was a lovely crab salad with asparagus & yellow and red tomatoes.  Ahhh perfection. Next we had eggplant with vine ripened tomatoes and cheese (the kind escapes me, it WAS a wine pairing after all). Once that was finished we had squid with a side of greens & toasted chickpeas. It was so delicious! When the lamb came out I was thrilled (ohgodsodamngood) it was paired with a small onion, asparagus, and crusted pork belly - mmmmm. Next was a bison tenderloin which was easily my favourite. At this point I was getting full and drunk! The desserts started coming, the first of which was a delicious ice cream sandwich with cookies, vanilla ice cream, and a delicious raspberry jam/drizzle! We finished that off with a small cheese board and finally, chocolate truffles. The presentation of each dish was well thought out and beautiful, and the wine pairings were truly beautiful and complimentary.\n\nI won't lie I loved every single thing we had and I ate everything off each plate. It was decadent and everyone in the group really loved it - not just the food, but the entire experience. It was such a special evening and one I wont soon forget. The food along with the amazing service ensured I will DEFINITELY be back, and I can't wait - that beautiful patio is a must!", "date": "2013-05-28 21:21:38"}, {"review_id": "PNjj9OKwUNfByuAEagPA5Q", "user_id": "nrRRt8n_gabWCoAwH6uVtQ", "business_id": "qHseX2NHeUUedIgs_VasZA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I wanted to like this place after reading reviews but I was severely let down.

Our waitress, Penny, extremely neglectful until the end of the meal when she paced back and forth in front of our table a record number of times compared to how scarcely we saw her while eating. \n\nFirst off, she took 2 other orders before ours even though we were sat before both those tables and were ready to order. Menus closed and everything. Next while taking our order she didn't write it down (which isn't a smart move in a restaurant with such a large menu) and got BOTH of our orders wrong. My friend asked for fruit, and was given hash browns. And I was not only missing avocado, but even though I emphasized to have my caramelized onions well down they came out almost raw.\n\nShe kept doing this extremely irritating thing where she would drop items and run away and not even give her paying customers an extra .3 seconds to ask her for something. When our wrong food arrived, once again, dropped and ran away. Waited almost 5 min for her to come back. She told my friend to just keep the hash browns while she just grabbed her fruit, and went to go have my omelet remade. I left my barely touched, incorrect omelet on the table edge with untouched potatoes (theres a difference between potatoes and hash browns here. They're two different sides) so finally my new omelet arrives, with no potatoes on the plate, yet she takes my incorrect plate, which had my potatoes, and doesn't come back with another side of potatoes for me.... potatoes that I paid for. So basically, I was served an omelet with no side and was forced to eat the cold, soggy hash browns that she didn't bother removing from the table when they came incorrectly with my friends meal. Nice.\n\nDon't see her, doesn't check in till almost another 10 minutes even though I see her wandering around the restaurant. \nWhich was crappy because my second omelet was gross. Yes, the onions were finally cooked, but the whole omelet was burnt and dark brown, plus THE ENTIRE THING WAS CHEESE AND TOPPINGS. I picked around it and basically left an uneaten, picked at scramble mess on my plate in front of me, obviously it was clear I didn't like it, and not a single inquiry from her as to why I barely touched my food. Every single thing about my friend and I was screaming that we were dissatisfied. From body language, to how our interactions with her changed throughout the meal, to the most obvious red flag which was that I barely ate anything. Then she leaves that mess in front of me till after she drops the check which took her 15 more minutes  (she did the classic run and drop without a word so we didn't even have the chance to complain). Aka I had these dirty plates in front of me till after we even payed. Which was when she was pacing back and forth in front of us straight up staring at us as we placed our money down. When she finally collected the plates she goes \"you done?\" Then grabs the dirty plates AND my drink that I payed $6 for that had almost half left in it, and runs away. Yes penny, I've been done with this terrible omelet for almost a half an hour, but no, I was NOT done with my barista beverage. At the end of the meal we purposefully sat, and I counted 7 times that she paced back and forth in front of our table staring at the checkbook which was in a place where she couldn't grab it. It's crazy how her presence improved once the money was involved. \n\nTo top it off, there was a man sitting at the high top on a laptop, who I assume to be a manager or someone of authority because employees were discussing business with him. He was faced directly at our table, less than 10 feet away, and didn't once notice our dissatisfaction. Terrible. \n\nI paid $30 to sip half of a drink, eat 3 bites of cold, soggy hashbrowns, and to pick through a mountain of swish cheese and burnt, scarce egg.\n\nMy friend and I have both been in the restaurant industry for almost 7 years. This was by far the most expensive and dissatisfactory meal we've ever had the burden of paying for. Penny had so many opportunities too, that is the worst part of this situation. She could have taken it upon herself to read our body language, acknowledge that fact that I didn't touch my food, taken 2 extra seconds to actually SPEAK to her guests and we would have been back and tipped her well for her efforts.\n\nAnother ironic part of the situation is that this was my friends first time here, and we were scouting for a nice, slightly upscale restaurant to host/cater a baby shower brunch for about 30 people.\nFor 2 of us our bill was $50, imagine having a party of 30. You do the math. That's a lot of business you just lost.\n\nBut sorry BLD, there's no chance we're coming back here.", "date": "2018-06-26 18:27:18"}, {"review_id": "m1Lg6-bWljqr4hlm_WnL0A", "user_id": "fccMIyBd6ZhFUVAhvSqsrw", "business_id": "mz9ltimeAIy2c2qf5ctljw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "One of the best shows I have ever seen in Vegas.

Don't expect to get help from an employee because I don't think there are any and at the very least, you'll probably stand a better chance getting run over by a heard of buffalo while in the store. Very often, when the merchandise is placed on the shelves there is absolutely no method as to how it's arranged. Things are mixed up beyond belief. For a current example, I recently I went there to buy an oil filter. I should have known better but I was in a hurry. When I got to the isle with the filters I found them all completely mixed up. They were placed on the shelves in no particular order with all the different sizes, and there are literally scores of different sizes, totally un-arranged and mixed up. It looked like someone just literally dropped the filters out of an airplane and wherever they landed that's where the employees put them. There was no reference book to find the filter number I needed. They had an electronic engine filter finder but it didn't work. Needless to say, I gave up.\nUnfortunately it's not just the auto department either. Same thing in lawn and garden. Same thing in housewares. etc., etc.\nIf you need to go to Walmert do yourself a favor and go to the one in Chardon.

With six girls and all varying tastes and preferences, this was a great choice! Mexican food is always a hit, and I particularly enjoy it, so I was really pleased when the birthday girl suggested it! She'd been here on a previous trip to Vegas and recommended it.\n\nWe came here at 11:00 because that was when they started serving lunch. They also offer an all-inclusive brunch of small plates, but we were not up for another buffet before the long flight home. We did order a couple of appetizers (guacamole and queso). The guac was really good, and the chips were a huge standout. Freshly fried, they were super fresh and difficult to stop eating. They came with three types of salsa, all of which were good. (None were particularly spicy, but they were all flavorful). The queso was a bit on the runny side for my taste, which also made it difficult to share.\n\nI ordered nachos for my lunch- if you know me, you'd expect this. The nachos suffered from structural issues in their construction. The beans were spread all over the bottom of the plate, with chips on top of them. Toppings were layered on top and baked, so the chips never stood a chance. They were super soggy by the time they made it to the table. The flavor was good, but I mostly picked the chips from the top and left the sodden bottom layer. I added steak to the nachos, and this was a very good choice- the meat was hot, cooked medium, and made a great addition to the dish.\n\nOther girls got tacos, and that's definitely what I would order the next time.

I usually like to walk around Target and was curious to see what the difference between a regular Target is and a Target Greatland but I spent less than 20 minutes here because of my dislike. I saw a small grocery section with cold and frozen food so I'm guessing that's the difference.

I purchased my timeshare in 2005 in Sedona and have stayed in about seven of them since then. Funny thing is that we have never stayed in our own, we don't usually visit he same place twice.  From Montana to South Florida, we have certainly have gotten great use out of our timeshare purchase.  \n\nWith that being said, I found this resort to be one of the best we have ever stayed at.  We reserved a two bedroom for 5 of us, two couples and a young adult child.  We were assigned to the Rosemary tower which was one of the newly renovated towers.  We had both rooms for the lockout suite, which included two full 1 bedrooms to give a total of two King bedrooms, 2 kitchens and 2 living rooms.  The rooms are connected by an outer area, and we were able to keep the doors open to feel like we have a huge open apartment.  The space we had was incredible.\n\nThe resort is situated right next door to the Southpoint casino.  When you check in at the resort they give you coupon books for the casino.  When you go to the resort, go sign up for the rewards program before you purchase or do anything.  It only takes 5 minutes and with the 1st coupon in the book, you get $20 free slot play.  We had fun with the 4 of us playing our $20 each.  No one won but we had fun.  The rewards card gets you money off the buffets and the coupons give free bottles of wine you can take back to your room. \n\nI was quite surprised at how the good the food was at the buffets.  The prime rib was really good.  We went on Surf Turf and grapes night.  Each adult buffet came with 2 free glasses of wine and then we took a bottle back to our room with the coupon.  \n\nThe next morning we went back for the buffet $6.95 a person with your rewards card.  This included your coffee and juices.  Although not generally a fan of breakfast buffets, this one was decent.  The negative, this one is packed.  It \"closes\" at 10 am and you must clear out by 10:30.  We got there about 9;45 and it was a madhouse.  Get there early!  And opt for the fresh omelet station, well worth the wait then the buffet scrambled eggs.\n\nOne of the best things about the resorts was the pool.

It replaced what used to be Hot Dog on a Stick there.  Prices range around 6.95-9.95 for an entree.  The ambiance is the mall pretty much.\n\nI went here for lunch with a few friends today.  Another friend of mine was raving about the hummus there.  I went with a standard Gyros Sandwich + Side Salad + Drink for 6.95.  It was a great price.  The salad was large with olives, peppers, feta, and beets.  The dressing was a balsamic.  Out of all the greek restaurants I've been to in Chandler, I was shocked to find this place had such a good salad.  The beets were an unexpected surprise, and the dressing was tangy.  The gyros had salad and tomatoes topped with gyros meat and tzatziki sauce.  The pita bread was warm and there was a lot of meat.  I think a few more sliced onions could've made it spectacular, but it was better than a lot of sandwiches I've had elsewhere.\n\nIt wasn't 5 stars because the gyros could've used just a little bit of onions and maybe something else, but it was fantastic nonetheless.

The sad truth is that, over the past 6 months to a year, Water Wings has gone downhill dramatically and drastically. My kids no longer swim at Water Wings for several reasons, but my chief concern was many new and inexperienced swim teachers that simply put, do not know how to effectively teach children to swim. Unfortunately, most of the seasoned instructors from years past either no longer work with the company or have moved to California to work at the newest location. I paid for private lessons (not cheap) and in many classes the primary instructor was busy \"training\" a new instructor or chatting with a colleague. I understand training is necessary but it shouldn't take away or undermine the meat of the lesson, especially considering the cost and limited time allotment.\n\nAs a parent one of my main concerns - besides the instructors' inexperience - is the lack of accountability for children's safety. Employees are neither background checked nor drug tested, which in my opinion, is unacceptable when staff is in direct contact with children. (Not only, but you are quite literally putting your children's lives in their hands when you hand them over in a pool.) Additionally, the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary. This became more apparent to me after switching my kids to swim at another facility. There have been many incidents over the years (dirty play area, grimy shower area, floating grossness in the pool) but the one that stands out to me was when an individual had vomited in the locker room. I notified the staff and instead of properly cleaning it up, they had sprayed it repeatedly with a noxious cleaner (but did not wipe or clean the area). Eww. \n\nThe front desk staff is hit or miss. Some of them are super sweet and accommodating and some are rude and standoffish. As though they are better than you. Interesting. I've overheard them gossiping about their colleagues and other friends and even clients! Talking sh*t about your clients - and their kids - is not the best idea and is certainly unprofessional. I could go into more details but I think you get the point. \n\nMoral of the story is - I would have recommended years ago hands down.

We finally got up here to try Elvira's over the weekend and are so glad we did.  The first thing I noticed was how clean and sunny the restaurant is, which makes for a pleasant atmosphere.  They had some music playing, but not too loudly and there were some fantastic aromas coming out of the kitchen.\n\nWe didn't want to get too crazy because we had to run some errands afterwards, so just stuck with the oxtail lunch ($10.99) and the stewed chicken ($8.99).  I opted for the coconut rice & beans, and my husband got the white rice and stewed beans with his.  First thing, the meats are so tender and flavorful, I can't even begin to describe them.  I don't know anything about the seasonings they use, but together they provide very warm flavors that create perfect comfort food.  \n\nThen the next thing, you have to take some of your rice and put it in the broth that comes with the meats so it can soak up those wonderful flavors too.  Oh my God, but that was good.  A couple of maduros and a cup of potato salad come with the meals as well.  I love maduros and don't get to eat them very often, so they are always a treat.  The potato salad was nice and creamy and eggy, just like grandma used to make.  \n\nThey also had conch soup on the daily specials board, and when Elvira overheard me say I forgot to order some, she brought us a little sample with rice to try.  That was delicious as well.  Dining here makes me want to learn more about the seasonings they use.  That was our first time here, but it definitely won't be the last.

We were very impressed and have now been there another 3-4 times. I personally like a variety of flavors in my meals so this place is excellent. You get a variety of BBQ sauces from which to choose for your meat. The potato salad is creamy and not mustardy but if you want some, you can get a packet at the condiments corner.  The baked beans are sweet and just perfect in my opinion. We took home the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious right out of the fridge. I actually prefer it cold better than warm.  The corn pudding is fine but lacked flavor in my opinion. There is a small loaf of cornbread that is good and honey is found in packets at their condiments corner. Every time we go there, nice young men circulate the room to be sure your food satisfies you. My hubby and I have settled on this as our favorite place to eat BBQ. They cater and we will surely be using them for that. The prices seem very reasonable for catering.

We tipped and left. Now they're calling trying to get more money from the Groupon because the tech did Gel on my nails and the Groupon didn't cover it. Are you kidding me?! I told her 4x I didn't want Gel! She finally convinces me. Doesn't tell me it's extra. Finishes and we leave and now she wants more money. She knew the deal.

My primary motive for using him was he was fairly priced and he was close. I had many other quotes but he was the lowest.

Even with enhanced security the lines to pass through the metal detectors were short and the list of prohibited items was clearly displayed. And security did their jobs thoroughly without any attitude which is appreciated. \n\nOnce you step inside you'll find wide, uncluttered concourses and clear and concise signage to help you find your seat quickly. When I had a question I had no trouble finding a staff member and they were friendly and helpful. \n\nAnd once you have a seat you'll find that compared to some arenas T-Mobile has a slight bit more leg room...it may not seem like there's much but if someone has to pass by you to get to their seat and they have their hands full there's just enough space for them to pass and not trip on people's feet or the seats. And the steps are wide enough and spaced appropriately to help avoid a tipsy / vertigo effect that some arenas have. \n\nSight lines to the arena floor are very good. I'm not exactly short and the seat banking was enough that for once the people behind me didn't complain about the tall guy in front of them blocking the view.

And I didn't have to wait 15 minutes for my wife as she was able to get in and out quickly, and she said the restrooms were actually clean. Compared to other venues this is definitely a much better experience. \n\nParking: I know locals loved free parking but you can kiss that goodbye. MGM makes it easy to go online and pay for parking in advance and get a discount if you order at least 24 hours ahead of the event. Print out your receipt, come to the event, and the parking staff makes it easy to get into the parking garage. I'll go so far as to say this was the best parking experience I've had at any arena, stadium, or large event that I've ever been to! Once you're in the garage just look up as any open parking spaces are marked with a green light. It makes finding a space so easy! And exiting was just as easy as it took less than 10 minutes from when we left the parking space to being back out on the street and heading for I-15! \n\nIn short, T-Mobile definitely reflects the latest and greatest in arena design, and you can tell a lot of thought was put into the overall visitor experience. 4 Stars. (IMHO T-Mobile blows Mandalay Bay's arena and the MGM Grand Garden out of the water...it's superior in every way to those venues).", "date": "2017-11-06 19:26:27"}, {"review_id": "QroRJy3-reHwcg5FTSD0Rg", "user_id": "G18dOr4SHJ57GSUs23qy1g", "business_id": "a2gWIG98DdT2nZBqNeYU9g", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place was friendly and helpful.

Walked our dogs out on a rainy day and was given a formal warning because we walked back in through the front door because we didn't want to walk around the building to go through the back door designated for pets in the pouring rain. However if your car is in the valet they don't mind if you walk your pets through the front, go figure. The pet area stinks so bad!

The layout is well done - so if you wanna mix into the crowd, there is a huge huge dance floor downstairs, and the music really rocks with lots of 80's (yeah I'm an 80's kid.) and less of R&B which gets sickening after you hear at any club you go.

I have been to the Ahwatukee location a handful of times and have had decent experiences. There was nothing decent about this experience. \nFirst, we arrived at about 635p and happy hour ends at 7. We did not anticipate getting there in time for happy hour, but we were so that was a bonus in my mind. However, the hostess said there would be a wait even though there were 2 empty tables and one empty booth within sight. After waiting for about 10 minutes, we were just about to ask what was wrong with the empty tables when she sat us at the very booth that had been sitting empty the whole time we were waiting. WTH?\nThe waitress asked for our drink order and my old lady asked if it was still happy hour prices, and the waitress said \"if it is before 7\". WTF? The answer is a yes or no. I checked my phone and said it was 650p, so is that yes?  Then I asked if they had Guinness on draft, since there were HH prices on import drafts. She said \"yes, but there's no specials on Guinness\". \"What about this list of HH prices?\"  \"We don't do those anymore.\"  \"So none of these prices are valid?\"  \"Let me check\"\nAs for the food, yawn. The wings were not nearly as good as what I have gotten at the Ahwatukee location. \nThe Guinness did taste good though.  The old lady got a skinny Rita which was also a HH special, but they overcharged us for it. By that point, I was so sick of the servers attitude, I just paid it and took the difference out of her tip.\nNeedless to say, the next time we are looking for wings in this area, someone else is getting our business.", "date": "2013-08-03 15:20:14"}, {"review_id": "h5LaXKdlPeQLEZLcoUKklg", "user_id": "N2sBqKb8g1Lo9PnjTsymQA", "business_id": "Bqp7egV-_JiRD_b-qAqtlQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is phenomenal!

The front desk at this location looks like its a family living room behind the front desk, and although the gentleman who checked me in was pleasant enough, I just had a bad feeling.\n\nWe got to our room, opened the door, and were just shocked. We had asked for a nonsmoking room, and even though it had a nonsmoking sign on it, it absolutely reeked of cigarettes. The beds were stained, sagging, and looked like they might be crawling with something. Besides the cigarette smell, there was some sort of other odor in the room; I can't put my finger on it. Musty, maybe. It was just bad, and as I said, I am not picky with motels at all. We decided that we just could not stay here.\n\nLuckily there was a La Quinta across the streets that accepted dogs, so my husband went back inside to get a refund.

My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. They had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. We were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? \nUmmm, say what? \nFirst rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. \nAnd here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. \nUM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. \nAnd it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out.

I was so thirsty.\n\n I did not see a theme for the fair, the whole layout looked sloppy and thrown together.  No seating at all.

We arrived on time, filled out our forms quickly but then had to wait around for 10-15 mins while they waited for other people to show up. Finally the instructor came and got our \"group\" together and went through a long speech teaching us about the equipment, how to use it, and how to stay safe. Just as he was finishing up, another family that arrived late were added to our group. The instructor started over from the beginning and we had to listen to the entire speech again. The instructor then had us demonstrate several procedures we just learned, culminating by zipping down a test zip line that is about six feet off the ground. I was not happy to find out that they consider this zip line #1 of 5. The \"zip line\" is a joke, it takes about three seconds to descend three feet. Calling this a zip line is practically false advertising. We waited for the entire group to finish the test jump, listened some more, and were finally free to go. It had probably been 45 mins at that point since we arrived.\n\nMy friend and I jumped to the front of the line and were able to get right into the course for #2. It was the first time I'd done this so I was slower than my friend but we still managed to keep up a good pace without much effort. The climb was fun and the obstacles were interesting if not overly challenging. The landing strips are not well designed, they slope upwards at a crazy angle and trip you but the wood chips are relatively soft so we didn't mind. The zip was fairly long and the view of the forest was pretty cool. I was actually starting to think that all that waiting around was paying off.\n\nThat feeling lasted until we got to zip line #3. There was a half dozen people waiting below the first tree and at least as many already up in the trees on the course. This wasn't my group, who was coming up behind us, we had already run into the group before us. The instructors tell you that you can \"play through slower groups, just like in golf\", and that's true in theory but it's false in practice. You can only have three people on each platform, one person on each crossing, kids can't be more than one crossing away from a parent, and lines form and platforms fill up. You can't just skip in front of everyone who is in line, and you can't tell people to stop and stay where they are so you can move to the next platform. You can skip around people now and then but expect to get stuck frequently. So, back to the story, after all that waiting we basically did one zip line, then got in line to start waiting again. Now I was ready to ask for my money back at this point. We'd been there a long time and had spent very little time having any fun. After failing to find any employee anywhere, I took a long walk back to the office to complain, and they gave us permission to skip straight to four. We proceeded to station #4 which, thankfully, only had a few people on it, well ahead of us.\n\nWe completed four then we followed the path to #5 which led to a tree with no way to climb.  We were very confused and wanted to ask someone but there was not an employee anywhere within sight or earshot. After blowing our whistles for about five minutes, finally one of the instructors came walking slowly up the path and informed us with annoyance that #5 was closed. He acted like we should have known even though no one told us and there were no signs posted.  I wish they'd told us when we got there that 1 out of 5, actually let's be honest here, that 1 out of 4 zip lines were out of commission. We could have rescheduled for another day.\n\nSo the instructor tells us that since #5 was closed, we could repeat one of the other zips. So we went back to #3 where the last people from our original group were still waiting to go up on three so we got in line. We finally got up and were able to go around one family but almost immediately got stuck behind another family. After we zipped three, we went to redo four but four was now full with another group and so was two. We decided to redo three instead and walked back over to it. We got up quickly this time but quickly got stuck behind another family.  We finished the zip and that was it, we were done.  We were fairly disappointed.\n\nSo let's recap. The first zip line is a lie. The other courses are short, but still frequently congested. The only reason you don't finish the entire thing quickly is because you're inevitably stuck waiting behind people.  This says to me that there are too many people on the course.  They seem understaffed; you can never find an employee except near the office.  At $57 a person, more than the cost of a Cedar Point ticket, you should be getting a premium experience; this isn't it.

It has some comfy couches and is very clean and hip. The music was pretty good as well.\n\nWhat I disliked: I'm sure our company would have told them we were planning to be there from 6:30-11:30 and we wanted a cocktail party.  If it's a cocktail party, there definitely should be music, but it was blaring all night.  This would be great if it were a bunch of university students clubbing, but the DJ should have thought it through that it is a COMPANY party and people want to mingle for the first few hours.  At least give us 2 hours until 8:30 to hear ourselves talk and then you can blast the music up at 8:30-9 so people can start dancing.  Another dislike was the infrequency of the food.  I probably had about four bites all night at the venue and I was there from 6:30 to 10.  Another coworker and I got so frustrated, we left at 7:30 to grab some real food.  I don't know if this was our company being cheap, but my coworker said he attended a b-day party here and ran into the same situation.  \n\nMy last and final dislike was the food.  While I thought the meat was pretty good, why did everything have to be served on a chip, cracker or just be fries?  You could have at least served it on bread.  \n\nVerdict: Seems like a good clubbing place, but doesn't seem like a great dinner place or to hold \"professional\" parties.", "date": "2013-12-07 00:38:48"}, {"review_id": "h-7085gwMaYGrrCAZ_uEPQ", "user_id": "Bi4nYeSt_st0FkTgWwxlYg", "business_id": "Z6l0-bY6TklTdr_X88LFVQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Two words: Easy Peasy!!

The burger patty was maybe 4oz...where's the beef??...definitely more toppings than burger patty and served with warm not hot trio fries.

As far as buffets go, the Bellagio is the best. I've been to a lot of buffets both in Las Vegas and other states. I am rather fond of buffets as I'm a big eater. The food choice is excellent and some of the food is great even as a stand alone dish. I agree with some of the other reviews that there has been somewhat of a decline over the last 10 years, but again as far as buffets go, it's still the best. I've tried the Wynn, Bacchanal at Caesar's and pretty much every other buffet on and off the strip and the quality/taste of the Bellagio buffet is still the best. The Bacchanal has Bellagio beat as far as the sheer number of choices and the Wynn is comparable, but I still give the nod to the Bellagio. I'm actually not a big fan of the crab legs, but I found that the taste/quality of crab legs are pretty much the same at all the top $ buffets. Bacchanal's crab legs were the mostly frozen, although the quality was fine, with the Bellagio and the Wynn pretty much the identical. I enjoyed the meat station at the Bellagio the best with Bacchanal meat station having the most choices, but lacking the quality. If I had to rate the Bellagio compared to other stand-alone restaurants, obviously it would not be 5 stars, but I think it's only fair to keep restaurants in categories. The price is around $40.00 so it's expensive for a buffet but not unreasonable compared to other high-end buffets and certainly not that expensive compared to other restaurants, where you could easily spend that much per person at the Cheesecake factory with apps, entrees and desserts.", "date": "2016-03-17 15:44:25"}, {"review_id": "5BjE6sAxeJXp3XSwgLEOSA", "user_id": "NS3B17yHv2lBJfGuwSmVNw", "business_id": "NCFwm2-TDb-oBQ2medmYDg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Love the Bellagio fountains.

The food itself is purposefully varied in both texture and taste. I can't tell you which bite was my favorite. Maybe the tender mussels cooked in coconut sauce, the crunch of the fried chicken adobo dipped in the mango hot sauce, the lettuce wrap with lechon and slaw as a fresh palate cleanser, the sweet char of the brocollini, the fall off the bone pork rib in a sweet sticky sauce, that creamy center of the devilled egg, the subtle sweetness of the cornbread.... you get the idea.\n\nAlso, did I mention you eat all of that with your hands?

This time, it was fabulous.  The cakes were moist, tender, and really tasty.  Prices still high, but this time it seemed worth it.  They have lowered the prices for a dozen cupcakes and dropped the box charge.  They also took cereal off the menu.\n\nMinus 1 star because of the prices and because the gelato that comes with the $6 pairing wasn't that great.  The serving was also really small.  I'll skip the gelato and stick with a cupcake and a nice glass of milk when I go back.  I'd also prefer a sweeter, less greasy frosting, but that's a personal taste thing and It's probably not fair to fault them for my personal preference.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the changes.  It made for a really nice evening to sit at the outdoor bar and enjoy a great cupcake on a warm spring evening, and I look forward to doing so again soon.\n\n*******\nI REALLY wanted to love this place.  I went in a few days after they opened and was disappointed to see that they are very overpriced.  But I didn't let that get me down.  I figured the prices must be reflective of the quality, and I got ready to sample what I expected would be some phenomenal cupcakes.  \n\nTo my dismay, these expensive cupcakes are really not that good.  The few I brought home for everyone to sample were extremely dry and bland.  The texture reminded me of the free hunk of cake you get for your birthday at cheesy chain restaurants.\n\nI'd had very high hopes for the salted caramel, but there was no hint of salt and the caramel element tasted like sugar that had been burnt, not caramelized.  The Red Velvet had a hint of cream cheese flavor in the frosting, but wasn't very sweet and had no chocolate flavor.  The high point was the strawberry balsamic, which was a nice combination of flavors but, like the others, very poorly executed.  It was really just a plain, dry, flavorless cupcake with some pretty decent strawberry frosting (which I actually liked very much) and a drizzle of thick vinegar.  Overall though, I'm sorry to report that  I've had better cupcakes from a box.\n\nSpeaking of boxes, if you want one to carry your cupcakes home in, It'll cost you $1.  With as much as they're charging for the cupcakes, you'd think they'd give you something to carry them home in.  Nope.  That's extra.  Insult to injury, if you will.\n\nI'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again in a few months to give them a chance to get into the swing of things and, with any luck, turn out a better cupcake.  My hope is that the strawberry balsamic frosting is an indicator of a potential that they will reach once they get past the first few weeks.  Unfortunately, I don't know that they'll be around in a few months and I'm also not sure that I'd be willing to pay their insane prices even if the cupcakes were to improve substantially.", "date": "2008-04-29 03:23:11"}, {"review_id": "E9nrMfLMbuKTrnXxXMHu_w", "user_id": "XnTpd2R_PjBgCabdvg5Lvg", "business_id": "wc7vEJocrLXu3n_y7y2Tag", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Moved quite a bit farther away from my regular shop so I decided to search Yelp for a possible replacement.

I spent approximately 4 hours at the shelter, and adopted the only pup I asked to interact with. All the staff members/volunteers I encountered were cordial and helpful.

That being said, there is nothing worse than a lackluster plate of eggs. Oh, but I'm wrong! Couple mediocre eggs with poor service, Beach Cafe showed me all sorts of low.\n\nWalking in, it is generally expected for you to seat yourself - after you overcome the awkwardness of glares from the bar patrons in the back. Service was generally slow, leaving us to scramble for menus and wait a few minutes before even being greeted. \n\nI had ordered the Cali Bene - eggs benedict with avocado, tomato, spinach with a side of home fries. One of my friends stuck to her favorite of chicken fingers (with the sole intention that the ranch was made in house). While one of my other friends, wavering with indecision, chose the Redondo Beach Egg Salad Sandwich with a side of Chicken Tortilla soup. The food came out promptly, so I'll give the Beach Cafe that. However, taste was lacking. Hollandaise sauce soaked half the plate, which normally I do not mind. However, it was so salty that I attempted to dissect the parts of my benedict that had not been attacked with sodium. After three minutes, all hope was lost - my Cali Bene was fairly inedible. The home fries were decent, better in comparison to the salt fest next to it. As for my friends' food, the chicken fingers were good (not a difficult accomplishment). My other friend quickly demolished her soup (as much as I love brunch, so has the same affinity for soup). However, her egg salad sandwich was primarily two pieces of bread with a thin layer of egg salad. I took a bite, and was unimpressed - my school's dining hall has done better. \n\nWhat really set in my apathy towards this place was the lack of cordiality demonstrated by both the staff and the longstanding patrons. After a couple had left the restaurant, one of the staff members had engaged in openly mocking and criticizing them. The heckling riled the customers she had been talking to, and soon spread like wildfire. My party felt fairly uncomfortable afterwards - both out of shock for their lack of propriety as well as the fear that our departure would result in insult. \n\nHonestly, mediocre at best food.

Every order took forever: it almost seemed like she was moving super slow on purpose.

Two more orders came up, but she just kept doing whatever she was doing.

The staff was nice, cleanly, knowledgeable of the ingredients (all the sauces & mayo are made from scratch), and were smart enough to get my order right.  That's a HUGE plus.   \n\nI had never been here when it was the Willo House so I have no reference to the extent of the remodeling but - as it is now - the interior is very nice with beautiful wood floors, fun paint colors on the walls, artwork everywhere featuring local artists, and several different rooms all with a different feel where you can hide & chill, be amoung people, or even seat 8 or 10 and hold a meeting.  I'm with Kenny B... I could sit here for hours and check out the eye-candy.\n\nI had a spinach salad with chicken, mandarin oranges, and candied pecans.  It was a good salad - my only complaint was that the chicken on the salad was actually chicken salad.  I was expecting grilled chicken (no mayo) but it was still very yummy.\n\nMy b/f had a spicy chicken salad sandwich which - to me - was too spicy but the sweet little side of cole-slaw contrasted the fire and cooled it down a bit.  I probably wouldn't order it again... but the selection of sandwiches drew my attention enough to already have picked out my \"next time I'm gonna have...\"\n\nSo yes, for me... there will be a next time.  However, I'm giving it a 4 because I agree with most reviewers... it's a bit overpriced.  It was $22 for lunch for 2 people (a salad, a sandwich, and 2 drinks).

Following the allure of the neon yellow and blue sign I return once again to my favourite get your clothing clean hang out Oh Henry's Laundromat & Dry Cleaners on 18th Avenue SW.  Having convenient daily hours of 8 am to 10 pm, Oh Henry's is the best place to be to relax to an orchestra of humming washers and dryers, and to be serviced by helpful and effervescent staff.  This establishment has been around for more than 12 years according to the lady working there. For a mere 3 dollars and a handful of odd quarters I can always count on getting a double load of laundry done.  At every visit my clothing turns out consistently clean and the dryers do a great job of drying as well.  \n\nA line of 70s vinyl brown chairs line the waiting room area facing a 40 inch television where \"Dances With the Stars\" is just about to begin, the lady there returns to the television to increase the volume yet for the third time asking me where Cheryl is?

I am now folding my second load of clothing, and notice the hand sharpied prices of pop, chips and the odd candy bars if you so need to nibble on something to pass the time.  Certificates line one wall of the establishment citing it as the \"Best Laundromat in the City of Calgary\".  Looks like Oh Henry's has claimed this prize for 8 years of its more than 12 years' incarnation.  Worthy of this merit, I must say, I always feel incredibly relaxed when I come here, and can always count on a random conversation with the local yokels and a very clean establishment.\n\n If you need clean laundry, ironing or drying cleaning done then this warm and modest place is the place to come.

These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, \"Oh yeah. The container arrived last week.\" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.\nNext was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.\nAnd then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.\nMy brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.\nBottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.", "date": "2015-11-18 19:10:00"}, {"review_id": "XQ0hbOjTt-pKVyhtTKmQfA", "user_id": "by5zen9RLjr0nRKZJOwLfQ", "business_id": "HOU5UUTb29yLmEz_0hteEw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Lovely Friday night Italian dinner.

My husband said the barbacoa was his favourite but he didn't order the beef cheek so what does he know? :P\n\nWe ordered two cocktails - pina mojito and spicy margarita - and then shared them because each was good and went well with some tacos over others.

This was the one thing on the menu I couldn't wait to try. It's Chef Rachel's twist on Coq Au Vin. Seeing this dish arrive at the table, it looked presented well and I couldn't wait to dig in. The potatoes are made with 50 percent butter and tasted so effing delicious! If you order anything here, order the mashed potatoes! The chicken was served in a  dish that had no red wine sauce in it. I as well my friends agreed that this dish was lacking the sauce and was dry with out it. I asked our server for some of the red wine sauce to pour over the chicken and it made such a huge difference! I did get a free sangria with this meal which was a great deal however it didn't taste that great. \n\nStrawberry and Champagne Pancakes ($8) - These are dutch baby style pancakes. The price is very fair, but the way these tasted left us all needing a drink just to swallow each bite. Too crispy on the outside and still somewhat raw in the center. \n\nSalted Caramel Budino ($6) - Caramel toffee, vanilla custard and crunchy fleur de sel. Though not as good as the now closed DOCG, this one will do just fine. We also got some type of apple strudel (also $6) and we all pretty much enjoyed the desserts more than the actual food.\n\nThe menu is kinda limited, but I feel there's room for improvement and wouldn't be against giving Boteco another try in the future.

When I showed my technician right as she started my pedicure, she said, \"Ah, easy!\" So, I sat back and relaxed and figured all would be great. They asked if we wanted our fingers done, too and I declined because we were short on time. Am I glad I didn't pay for a manicure here! My daughter's nail tech said that she would include a paint job for my daughter at no extra charge since I was getting a longer pedicure. After seeing the awful job that was done on her nails, I am so glad that I only paid for a totally messed up pedi, not a messed up mani, too! The paint on her nails was incredibly sloppy. Her toes did turn out okay (not great,) so they were decent enough to go to Disney with, but my toes turned out HORRIBLY. The tech struggled to make a round circle to start off the head! The bottoms of both of the heads on my big toes was squared off! Plus, she was attempting to center the heads and one was way off to the left. Never mind the fact that the ears are proportionally way too small for the size of the rest of the head. It all looked awful! And then, to top all of that off, when she was painting them she accidentally dragged a line of black across the rest of my big toe and instead of fixing it properly, she just tried to just dab it with nail polish remover and then immediately paint over it. So underneath the 'mickey' head immediately began to chip! WORST PAINT JOB EVER! Finally, when I went to pay I was still going to leave a moderate tip, but when I handed the girl cash she acted shocked at the size of my tip and asked if it was for both techs or just one.

I looked at the reviews and felt that the place would serve us decent food. First off, the location is somewhat difficult to find.. We drove around the plaza and could not see it. The parking lot is on the opposite side of the building, so the restaurant is facing hwy 7. \n\nOnce we finally got there, it was half full so we were able to get a booth for ourselves. I really liked their menu, as it illustrates the majority of its menu items with pictures of the actual food. So when I was ordering my bento, I knew exactly what was coming. \n\nOur waitress was very accommodating and did her best to help us. My sister really dislikes salmon (I know, I don't understand it either...), so she asked the waitress to substitute her pieces of salmon sashimi for anything else. The waitress agreed and didn't charge us extra for the substitution. So, my sister has the sushi+sashimi bento and I had the chicken teriyaki combo and the sushi appetizer.\n\nThe bentos looked great and we were both hungry, so we dug in right away! Everything tasted great in my opinion, but one thing was a bit off. When my sister and I both tried the sushi, we were surprised to find that there was wasabi already added on the rice underneath the fish itself. Now, to me that was okay, but to someone like my sister who avoids spices it was not. We asked the waitress about this and she informed us that this was the traditional way to make sushi. I don't disagree, that may be true..however, we've never encountered this at any other location. She told us that we were supposed to inform her while ordering that we didn't want the wasabi. Only problem was that nowhere was it written on the menu that they do that. \n\nRegardless, she switched my sister's sushi and everything was fine. We both enjoyed our lunch and were full for a while. I would definitely come back again and maybe try some of their Korean items!

We weren't going to wait in their line up for grilled cheese so I can't comment.\n\nPork Belly and their coffee both in my top 5. Pork sandwich could have included some crisp pork rind for that extra crunch but it was delicious and complete when compared to the other vendors. The coffee tasted great and amazingly smooth!\n\nThe Lemon Marscapone and the Salted Caramel Macarons were insane, out of the 6 or 8 flavours we tried. The big downside was how inconsistent the meringues were from flavour to flavour. The Vanilla Bean had a great taste but it was too hard to enjoy. I shared feedback to the vendor as she wanted to know my top choice, so I mentioned this inconsistency, and the woman told me all batches come out different. She would give my feedback to Katrina who makes them. I was then disappointed about the known inconsistency but more so with the fact that Katrina wasn't even at the event!\n\nLa Carnita was lined up and I have already eaten them twice in the past so we skipped that line. I am sure they would have been in my top 5 but they are certainly far from novice!\n\n1. Bahn Mi\n2. Chocolate Tamale\n3. Pork Belly\n4. Coffee\n5. Macaron\n(6. Rillette / Sauerkraut - it was just not my thing but it was well done!)\n\nBeyond those top treats, there were terrible items not worth mentioning and there were some near-hits. Some foods I suspect were great at home but weren't exectuted properly given the limitations of the environment. \n\nMy near-hits...\nHad the scotch egg been served room temperature instead of cold, more flavours would have come through and it possibly would have rated in my top 5 bumping the macaron.  The seasoned potato chips could have rated had they not been so inconsistent from chip to chip - some had seasoning while some lacked and others were just plain soggy rather than crisped. The Popovers were a great idea, poorly executed. We bought 3 figuring that each would be so unique but instead we found that the base was the same for all with a bit of bacon or feta sprinkled on top. As well, they were not warmed all the way through. I am not sure there is a way to serve awesome popovers, except right out of the oven!!

Our experience with this company began in January, 2012 and has continued to deteriorate over time.  Our air conditioner went out because of an electrical panel short.  We referred to the \"To Fix It\" list and identified an electrical company to come out.  They did a great job in fixing our electrical issues but could only recommend another company to handle the air conditioning issue.  It was a weekend and freezing cold and since we were so pleased with the service we received from the electrical company we believed what they said about One Hour AC&H.  They recommended a new unit, said our ducts needed to be completely redone because they were so old and deteriorating, vents need to be installed, that if we purchased this new unit our heating and cooling costs would be reduced by 50%.  That's what he said -- by 50%.  (BTW - our electric bill has not gone down one cent since installing the new unit.)  Over the course of 2 days they completely redid everything -- installation, all new ductwork and vents, a cleaning system.  The works.  Since then half of the our house is still warm; we've had service people out several times and they don't even know why they've been told to come to our house.  At one point we discovered that our filtration system had not even been hooked up.  Our son was asked to crawl up into the attic to help them complete the installation.  The vent holes were sloppily cut and some of vents don't cover the damage done to the drywall.  They installed a vent in our garage storage room!!!!!  We paid for the bi-annual servicing of the unit and every time we make an appointment they call and say that they've got so much to do they can't make it out to our house.  They did that to us 3 times and at that point we told them if they didn't show up the fourth time we wanted our money back for the service plan.  A service guy did show up this past weekend and wanted to know why we had several of our vents closed - we had done that to help with the lack of cooling on the one side of the house.  The service guy said it wasn't good to do that because it put pressure on the fan.  He then went up into the attic and came back down and said that there was a 2 inch gap in the ductwork which he said he fixed and that should help with the temperature.  He also said he would talk to his supervisors about this and that someone would be calling us.  We've tried talking to these folks many times and they never call back.  We to date have not received a call back as the last service guy promised.  Don't EVER use this company.  We found out later that they work on commission.  They are only interested in selling expensive units and have no intention of following up on their promises.  I'm embarrassed to let any of you know how much we paid (are still paying) for this experience. As part of the sales pitch we were also told that our new unit would be eligible for an energy-savings rebate from the electric company.  After we purchased the unit, and after we had to remind them of the rebate offer several weeks later, they submitted the rebate request, which was ultimately denied.", "date": "2013-10-03 17:54:15"}, {"review_id": "L944kGO4W-K5OOaFgEmBoA", "user_id": "AMOQdQtfGisU9aNfk7s2Sg", "business_id": "NN6HpdvQlGZUVjBwzhgUWQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Just stopped here for a quick lunch.

I don't know where it went wrong, she asked me about the razor length (I'm a female I have no idea what the means and the last stylist did not tell me what it was) since I didn't know she went with the shortest one possible, since the other one \"didn't make much of a difference\". As she made the first buzz cut on his hair I said oh jeez that is really short. Her words \"well, guess you will know for next time \" and proceeded to buzz my kids hair down to military length! The only part I asked her to shorten was the front and I'm pretty sure she didn't even touch that. Now I get it I am new to the way barber shops works but I had no idea that one shop can have such good stylists that make my kid look amazing and then another that even with a picture of the cut makes him looks Like he just finished basic training for the military! I'm horrified and embarrassed with his hair and other then totally shaving his head have really no choice but to live with it and with the looks that people give me for the WTF did you do to your kids hair! \n\nI'm giving this shop a decent review based on the first cut and the decent way they deal with little kids but I will be sure to watch out for some of the stylists in training they must have there or maybe she really didn't care because he was a little kid so what does it matter.

The store was pretty busy, but they had plenty of people ready to help you. \n\nI actually had something to return. I had purchased Angels On Bare Skin (a face wash) and it turns out I'm allergic to the lavender in it. Janea was super helpful. I explained to her what happened and that I just wanted to exchange it. She also helped me pick a new face wash. Janea even did a little demonstration on my hands using the face wash and a couple other products. Plus, she helped me find the perfect face moisturizer. It was great that she gave me a sample of the moisturizer to try at home. \n\nBecause it was the grand opening they had fruit kabobs and fruit juices. It was super cute that each juice was named after a Lush product.\n\nThis Lush is just like every Lush I've gone to as far as customer service. It's beyond amazing! Everyone is so friendly and are very helpful. You can tell they really love the product they sell. \n\nI love the set up of the store too. They have a facial bar where you can smell & touch the face masks. They have a wall of bath bombs and a whole table of hair care items. \n\nDefinitely glad to have another Lush store open in Las Vegas. I always love shopping there.

Since I've finished my degree I haven't been on campus a lot to clarify, but I don't know if I have the heart to go in and see for myself anyways. \n\nThere has always been something about this library, that could never be replicated by the University's new library building which resembles the Facebook headquarters and was a terrible mess to figure out (I worked temporarily in the library during the HDL's development. I find this new library kinda soulsucking, Everyone who likes this new library has no soul, or is obviously a business major or something. No offense).  \n\nSomething about MacKimmie used to inspire me to totally kick it old school. I would sit down for hours at a time \n\n Each winter at school, I lived for the days where I would get myself a giant cup of tea, head of to the 10th library tower, and hide out for hours at a time. Ofttimes, I would go laptop free, surround myself with all the relevant reading materials I needed, and draw up a first draw from scratch. I took so much enjoyment in doing this. I always kind of wonder how most students in university would fare without the convenience of the internet and having so much information at our fingertips. Really, anyone can graduate with a degree if they know how to use wikipedia. It's a bummer. \n\nOne time though, when trying to write a twelve page paper on Ernesto Guevara, I gathered a bunch of books which were mostly in Spanish, hoping that if I thought about it hard enough, these words would just fall off the page into English translations for me. This was not the case and eventually I did have to enlist the help of the internet for translation purposes.  But, MacKimmie is so magical, THAT IT MADE ME THINK I COULD JUST LEARN SPANISH BY STARING AT IT. \n\nMacKimmie would also remind me of the fragile and beautiful tangibility of books. It was in this very library that I fell in love with a first pressing of Kerouac's \"Big Sur,\" worn and weathered and dying to be checked out and rescued. While working in the library for awhile if I had nothing to do, I would often escape to the 10th floor and spend a few hours reading through Bukowski poetry. This was always such a treat. \n\nMacKimmie, if the rumours were true, I will miss you very much. You were not outdated. You were a REAL LIBRARY, and irreplaceable to me.

I started at RCR in 2013 after being introduced to the gym through a friend who coached at the gym at the time Ben. Immediately I felt welcomed by the coaching staff who spent much more time with me then they had to. I remember one instance within my first two months where coaches and owners Ken and Bryan spent over an hour after class working with me on my snatch, I must have gone through over 100 reps in that hour and I learned so much about positioning and speed. Coach Dylan did the same thing for me with muscle ups the following month and eventually I got one. It's hard to remember all the times that coaches spent extra time with me after or before class(and we would be here all day if I told you), but I can tell you that had to be hundreds during my nearly 3 years at Ramsay. \n\nThe Classes at Ramsay are a hour long each but often you'll find people show up quite early to stretch and socialize with other members.  The format generally consists of a warm up then a strength or skill portion followed by a Metcon. The strength portion and metcons are almost always programmed as a part of a bigger picture with a focus on certain skills whether it be Olympic lifting, Gymnastics, Conditioning or any combination of those and I saw very consistent and steady improvements during my time at Ramsay. \n\nIf your looking to get into Olympic weightlifting RCR also has a barbell club which is fantastic. I spent the majority of my last year with RCR working on Olympic lifting with coach Geoff. He also led me through my first weightlifting competition which was a blast. The barbell club has to be one of the funnest group I've ever had the pleasure to train with and I've made some great friends through the club. \n\nIf I had one final thing to say about RCR I would say that most people walk through the doors hoping to get fit but the reason most people stick around is because of the community, I made a lot of great friends during my time at RCR and had some great experience as a result of my time there.", "date": "2016-11-10 02:20:42"}, {"review_id": "X3mno8zvyar6bPkd8oyJTg", "user_id": "XUwYlVRuyoImgtaw8Cjztg", "business_id": "dM_bvkmRli5sbvSik_uDMw", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "While getting a mobile Detail in the basement of this building my husband, toddler and I headed upstairs to have brunch here. \nThey don't offer any Vegan items so I was a bit disappointed however they did have something I was able to then Vegan however it was super tiny and unfulfilling.

I was really hoping this experience could be positive but things were just not good by ANY standard.\n\nLocated in the heart of Terminal A, this is a quick bite to eat if you select the carry out side and not sit down.  I think this is my mistake.  Upon arrival, seems like any usual quick eats location.  Chips, drinks on the outside of the cashier, pizza waiting to be purchased sitting behind a window, cashier and 2 cooks waiting to take orders.\n\nWhen it was my turn to order I was greeted with a \"Welcome to Winners, what do you want?\" The tone and demeanor of the cashier was unfriendly to the point where I felt I was bothersome.  Brushed it off, and ordered the \"number\" on the menu.  The immediate response was an eye roll and \"what is that number?\"  After responding I was given a \"oOOOooh that one, a Winner's Burger.\"  The tone had a bit of snark in it as if I was expected to just order the name after the number that was sitting in front of it that was showing on the menu board.\n\nAfter paying, I stood back and watched to see if it was just me receiving treatment or if it was everyone.  Everyone got it, until a friend who worked at another establishment came.  Demeanor became very casual, smiles and laughs, and talking of \"whatchu gonna do after work guuurl?!?!\" all while taking the order of another customer was the hot topic of conversation.  Reading the facial expression and body language of this customer was obvious she was bothered by it, but she did not want to say anything.\n\nI waited a solid 20 minutes for my order of a burger and fries, and half of that time, the fries say there on the counter with lid open getting cold.  Burger came out but was not cooked to order.  Based on timing I could not afford to go back as I had to get to my plane.  Burger was ordered medium well but came back well done x3 and nearly had a crispy texture to it.  My fries had been solid and cold upon arrival which was bothersome as it could have been closed while I waited and not left open.\n\nAltogether, I feel a sit down experience may be better, but these three employees working the carry out side seem to be very disconnected with customer service and only there to have fun with each other.

My cravings were something fried, but also wanted some spicy soup to balance the two out. My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong!!! \n\nWe walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!\n\nI enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!\n\nMy minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. \n\nTheir side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.\n\nThis restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.\n\nThe location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!!

We said yes...but bread never came. \n\nWe ordered the appetizer Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos and chose the Asian style. The lettuce leaves were large enough to hold all the fillings successfully.

This was all good. \n\nThe meat however, was not ground beef as the menu description simply indicated. The meat was a broken apart flame-grilled hamburger.

This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.\n\nLet's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.\n\nI ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi/sashimi/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi/sashimi/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.\n\nEverything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi/sashimi/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.\n\nWhat probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.\n\nFree wifi! Password is the phone number.

We drove down to Hudson, Ohio from Michigan to visit a boutique that had the dress she was looking for. When we arrived, they told us the dress wasn't there (despite having called just a couple hours before and they said they were holding it). My poor sister was devastated, and understandably stressed and unhappy. We did a quick Google search for other boutiques in the area, and Something White came up. The designer she wanted was in their shop, however, we noticed it was closing in 20 minutes and we were about a 15 minute drive away.\n\nSo my sister called them, explained the situation, and without any hesitation they said they would stay open so she could try dresses on. WOW. We were already impressed with them!\n\nOnce we got there, we immediately felt comfortable. It has a homey feel thanks to the decor and the owners. They make it such a personal and wonderful experience. Thanks to them, my sister was able to find her dream dress!\n\nCut to four years later, and it was my turn! We knew we wanted to go back to Something White thanks to the experience we had with my sister. It was so exciting and surreal to be the bride this time, and their dress selection was a dream. I tried on about 7 dresses, and they were very respectful of my budget while helping me pick out the dresses. They made this experience so stress free, comfortable, and FUN! \n\nWhen it was my sister's turn, my mom and sister celebrated with champagne while I sipped on sparkling grapejuice (I wasn't 21 yet!).

Absolutely terrible service. I would give this store 1 star for the most terrible service we have received. The reason why I am giving this store 2 stars is that of the fact that the person that was helping us with the ski helmets were nice and brisk. He gave advice and was friendly at all times. Then I went with my family to purchase a north face jacket. It was originally around $540 but it was 25% off so it was $410. We wanted to see if we could get a better deal so we talked to the manager. He said no which I could understand but we still attempted to bargain. However what was not okay was his attitude towards us was really inpatient and unmerciful. He said that north face was really lucky to get them some deal for boxing day that was 25% off. I don't find this kind of attitude okay towards any kind of customer. I also realized that the people that worked there they got a commission. Basically, the woman that first helped us placed her commission id on the price tag. The second lady that helped us was outrageous. Saying that there is actually 50% off and then placed HER commission tag over the other lady's id. After that, she just left us not doing anything. When we got the cashier there was a fight over the price between the cashier and us and multiple managers came over. The one that we spoke to (he was bald I don't know his name) was in a very uncalming attitude saying that he already spoke to us and we are wrong and didn't listen when the other lady that placed her commission tag over said it was $300. So I don't understand who is hiring these people. The person that worked at the cashier used absolutely no manners but pounding in the fact that our price ($300) is wrong at our faces. My whole family was really upset and we just bought the ski helmet and left. I have always been sympathetic to businesses that give poor service but this was absolutely outrageous. Later on in the day we went to Vaughan Mills shopping mall and went directly to the North Face shop there. We got the same jacket for $300. Yea sure my *** that 25% off was good.

I'd never eaten at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant so I was excited to try it out.  Sad to say I'll probably never eat at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant again.  We all enjoyed our food, but the service was HORRIBLE. \n\nIt started with our waiter basically throwing the drink menu on the table. When he came back, the first thing he said was \"do you have any questions?\"  How about your name?  Luckily we were ready to order so he took it and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It took almost an hour from when we sat down till we received our food.  The tables around us all got their food before us, even tables that sat down after us.  One table sat down after us, ordered, ate AND paid before we got our food.  At one point the waiter came by and my friend asked him where our food was and he said it would be right out.  I was getting ready to go find the manager to ask about our food when the manager came to us.  He said our food was being plated as he spoke, but it still took another 5 minutes for it to arrive.  \n\nAfter the manager talked to us, our waiter barely came by our table; he wouldn't even make eye contact when he walked by.  He did manage to clear my drink glass, but didn't bother to ask me if I wanted another one.  After the wait we'd had, I would have taken a second drink, but I guess he didn't want us to linger.  \n\nIt was also disappointing that the manager didn't bother to compensate us for the long wait and crappy service.

If you decide to eat here you need to plan on staying 2-3 hours due to extremely slow service (even if you make a reservation on their special nights). It's always taken at least 20-30 minutes after being seated just to get waters, let alone orders taken. Some of the food is amazing, some is mediocre. Usually it comes out room temperature which is another bummer. The place is small, 11-12 tables maybe, usually with 2-4 people at a table. Last time we were there, we saw 3 different people waiting the tables but were also checking people out. Perhaps it would be easier for them if they had someone run the register and to-go area and other people work the tables. It really is too small to have these sorts of issues. Another problem is that we usually each order something from the first, seconds, and thirds on the menu but they ALL come out at the same time. Don't expect appetizers here. We also ordered iced coffees which were dropped off quickly without a word, and creamers were not offered until the next refill. And the cherry on top, is my poor 6 year old child almost always gets served his food last- which is just pancakes and fruit (the only thing on the \"kids menu\").

The other patrons at my table all enjoyed their meals with very well presented grub even though they had a lot of clients at the door.

First time to a restaurant, I always try to get a dish it's famous for. I really didn't see what the big deal was. It's basically a Monte-Cristo-type warm sandwich, no different than Chompies. My big complaint is when restaurants make these ''elite' sandwiches and the insides (meat, cheese, etc) are a big lump in the middle and the rest of the sandwich is plain bread because they couldn't take the time to actually spread out the ingredients so you'd get a good bite every time. The second big issue is since it's warm/heated, as it sits on the plate, the bottom can get soggy. Mine must have been sitting for a while because the bottom of the bread was mushy. Yuck. So their 'signature dish' was fairly tasteless, I had to spread the insides around with my finger, and it was soggy on the bottom. Triple Yuck. The pasta salad side was really good but the meal was already on the downside by that time. Or course I have a very small sample size of one visit and one dish, but it WAS a signature dish.

The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza.

Ma'am?!\"  the first time. (GRAH, don't call me \"ma'am\", I'm only 21, dammit!)   \nWhen I did hear her and turn around, she told me I had to leave my purse up front, which REALLY, REALLY ticked me off. I carry a very expensive bag and it usually has a very expensive phone and wallet full of cash in it. I do not let it out of my sight, ever. Ask any girl - being asked to leave your purse with someone just makes us uncomfortable. \n\nAside to the owner/managers:\nDear Ryan's, I'm sorry you have been stolen from, but that's a hard fact of retail business. Maybe 1 in 500 people will steal and it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be, ya cheapskates. You can absorb a $3 toy here and there. It's really insulting to be treated as untrustworthy and a criminal when you haven't done anything.\n\n(The purse bit set the tone for the whole trip). \n\nThe place was very dim (I know it's a warehouse, but it shouldn't be a 2/5 on the light intensity scale).\n\nThe prices were maybe $1.50 below retail stores at the most. It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10 minutes away, sure. \n\nThere were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed miffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we were down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing at the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when the girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super creepy.\n\n80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's mouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he needs tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it. I saw nothing truly suitable, unless we somehow missed it (and we walked through twice).\n\nTo top it off, they only carried 3 of the puzzle type toys, when they showed a dozen on their website. Nothing like driving to central Phoenix from Scottsdale and not having what you came for. Again, we looked everywhere in the warehouse and didn't see any more.\n\nWe left with the \"Dog Tornado\" (which is quite fun) and a knotted rope that looked pretty tough, but my dog has had it for about 30 minutes and has chewed halfway through the knot in the middle...

Lesson 1 is reliability, when you say you are going to be there to service a filter BE THERE. If something comes up so you can't be there let the customer know.

Kerry is great, Heather is great and my fianc\u00e9 said that Sarah was great. Unforunately, yesterday was one of the worst massages I've ever had. :( It felt very rushed and didn't quite feel like a \"professional\" massage.

I always get deep tissue massages so my pain tolerance is high. I carry a lot of tension in my shoulders and neck area and we both have issues with our sciatic. After my massage, I asked Kyra of possible techniques that I could do to alleviate some of the tension and her best reply was \"to drink water or lots of lemon water\". Thankfully, Sarah was very helpful and literally showed us a few good stretches to help other than drinking lemon water. In addition, hours after my massage, I had a little discomfort in the back of my neck. I had my fianc\u00e9 look at the back of my neck and he saw a pretty decent size scratch on my neck, from where Kyra was digging with her nails. \n\nIn addition, they forgot to give us locals discount and the bottled waters were warm, there was no ice and the bins for the robes and towels were overflowing.

Little did I know that this special place in line would allow me to talk for about half an hour with Denny and hear the entire story behind Little Miss BBQ.

Scott's enthusiasm and passion for his food is instantly contagious! I knew I needed to share this experience with my husband, but didn't know if I could get the food through airport security and back home to FL. Scott offered to vacuum seal my order so I could pack it in my suitcase. I was looking around to see if there were any video cameras and everyone was on their best behavior because they were being recorded. Nope, just a regular Thursday at Little Miss BBQ. I must have sat at my table for over an hour savoring every magical bite of \"fatty\" brisket, \"fatty\" pastrami and jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits. I couldn't tell you how their sauces taste because I didn't dare interfere with the flavor party already going on in my mouth. Scott and Denny both checked on me while I was sitting there to make sure I was enjoying my experience. I didn't ever want to leave. I felt like a VIP even though I was just a regular customer. Scott helped me pack up my leftovers. I took my leftovers along with my vacuum sealed to-go order And headed to the airport with grease on my chin and a huge smile on my face. When I returned the rental car, the attendant asked how my day was and I gushed about my lunch experience. He jokingly asked me if I brought him any and I handed him my leftovers.

One of the things I really like about this buffet is they don't \"put the clock\" on you, so to speak. Lots of other places either enforce a hard 2-hour time limit on drinking or start not-so-subtly shoving you out the door around that time. I like to take my time, eat at least 3-4 plates, and enjoy my alcohol instead of just slamming stuff down. On my most recent visit this past Saturday, we were here for 3.5 hours. I was able to enjoy my food and mimosas so much more this way, and it felt much more relaxed for my admittedly hungover and slightly lethargic brain.\n\nWait time can get really, really bad, but at 11 am this past Saturday am, it was only a 20 minute wait. Admittedly, it is wintertime and therefore off season, so I'm sure this isn't always the case.\n\nWhile their food isn't necessarily over-the-moon incredible like some of the other buffets, they have plenty of delicious if basic offerings. The omelette station was fun and line wasn't too long, the peppercorn-crusted meat offering was delicious although a little too rare for my taste, and the veggie covered pizza was awesome. They had a cheese ravioli in some sort of insane vodka sauce, which was my favorite I think, and their mountains of crab legs were a fun group bonding activity. Sorry to the gentleman I hit with part of a leg shell while cracking a particularly difficult leg. They also have a good amount of Asian-inspired offerings, including decent sushi and pork buns. Their desserts left a little to be desired; the macaroons were pretty but lacked much flavor; their cheesecake was underwhelming, and the pumpkin tart was also not the best. \n\nOur waitress was adorable, and in my experience the waitstaff here is always awesome. The coffee is delicious, and service was prompt to fill up the water, coffee, and mimosas. They also set down the OJ on your table and pour the champagne for you, letting you choose how much/how little OJ you want in your drink. As someone who mostly just likes OJ \"for color\", I really like this perk.\n\nOverall, recommend as the number-one buffet for a more chill, relaxed vibe for a leisurely brunch; if you want the wow-factor type food, I would recommend going elsewhere.

Kalbi is not a very tender cut to begin with because it is connective tissue but got this for lunch and the first three pieces were nothing but grizzle...which tells me it didnt get heated at a high enough temp or a bad cut of meat.  So I told the server to take it back and I ordered a Bulgogi in its place.  While waiting I knibbled on the little Kimchi dishes and rice.  When the entree was brought I asked if she could refill 2 or 3 of the Kimchi dishes and she said it would an extra cost...about a spoons full of vegetables.  So this kinda set me off and told her I have been coming there for 10 years and all...never charged an additional for replenishing the Kimchi dishes and I asked for the bill...paid the $18 plus dollars for three pieces of grizzle, a table spoons worth of rice and two teaspoons of cabbage...told them Id never be back.

Don't get me wrong, they were good, but probably not good enough to deserve an extra star.  Call me a foodie, but I want something to really wow my taste buds.\n\nOn the overall, this place had an awesome atmosphere.  It was a bit early, maybe 10 or 11am, so not too many people.  At each table they have a small Jukebox, and when you sit down your waiter or waitress gives you five nickels so that you can pick some music (songs are only 5 a selection).\n\nI ordered the Route 66 burger (mushroom burger) and my brother ordered some bacon burger.  I saw a sign in the restaurant that recommended my choice, but it was definitely a let down.  Not much flavor.  Sorta greasy, but lack of any flavor sorta killed it.  Actually, it was one of the worst mushroom burgers I've had, don't know how they screwed that one up.\n\nNow my brother loved his bacon burger, and I had a bite.  It was really good.  I guess I should never underestimate the power of bacon.  We never got a chance for a milkshake though, as the burgers were pretty filling.\n\nLast thing I should mention though is the dancing.  I think that everyone can agree two white boys getting down to Funky Town is hilarious, but for the whole song is a little much.  We felt so bad for them we left some extra tip.  Johnny Rockets, why can't you hire women to dance to music for our pleasure?  Why did it have to be men?  I probably would have added an extra star for female amusement.\n\nAnd btw, I don't know what was wrong with our jukebox, cause I could not get Jimmy Buffet's Cheeseburger in Paradise to play.

So I didn't feel bad when I also picked an apple to sample to see if I liked that kind.  The rows are clearly labeled, and we were there the first day of ambrosias, which are sweet and delicious.  The apples looked really small and so I assumed they'd be tart, but they were so juicy and sweet.  \n\nYou can get a wagon ride out to where all the apples haven't been picked yet, this can be a bit of a boring waiting process but it is a fun ride.  They didn't tell us when they'd be back to get us but it was about 40 minutes or so (next time I'd ask because it was a bit odd to wonder when they'd be back!).  \n\nIt's not cheap ($20 for a big bag full) but it was certainly fun.

It's the closest coffee shop to my house and, like I said, has great fair trade coffee. But Thieves keeps inconsistent hours and the barristas (owner included) seem uninterested in serving you.  Which, attitude aside, just makes everything take longer.\n\nHere's my anecdotal evidence: The first time I went to Thieves, when I got there, there was no one behind the counter.  I'd heard mixed reviews about getting served, so I thought I'd do an experiment and see how long it took.  After standing around for 7 minutes (and contemplating grabbing the cash register or one of those tasty croissants and making a run for it) a gentlemen who I now recognize as the owner reappeared (from the basement? outside? it was unclear.)  He moseyed over the counter where I was standing and took some time getting set up before looking up and saying, \"What can I get you?\"   No \"Have you been waiting long?\" or \"Sorry about that, I had to go and deal with an invasion of panthers downstairs!\" or another plausible explanation.

However, for my most recent trip to Scottsdale, AZ I went with Payless.  Why?  Because Hertz wanted $180 for a 1 day rental and Payless gave me a rate of $29!  Seriously!\n\nMy expectations were very low as I've rented from Payless before and wasn't too impressed.  I booked my reservation online via Expedia.  I took the airport shuttle from baggage claim to the car rental center which is a couple of miles away from the airport.\n\nIt was easy to find Payless, they're located at the middle-left side of the rental center sharing a space with Fox Rent a Car.  When I arrived, there was 1 person in line at Payless and 20 people in line at Fox....I think the people at Fox were jealous of how quickly we were able to get assistance...ha!\n\nThe check-in process was pretty fast, but it was a little frustrating having to give all of my information again....I guess their reservation system is not interfaced with Expedia because they didn't have any of my personal info and had to manually input it.\n\nAfter a short wait, I was given my contract and told to take the escalator down to the 1st floor where the Payless cars were located.  When I got to the 1st floor I went to the car rental desk which had 5 employees and 1 customer at the counter.  1 employee was helping the customer while the other 4 employees had a conversation that was too important to breakup and come help me.  After a \"are you going to f_cking help me?\" look from me to one of them they broke it up and came over to assist.\n\nThey gave me the keys to my car, a Honda Civic, and I went on my way.  The car was really nice and drove well.  It had a lot of power and room despite being a compact car.  Easily the best compact rental car I've driven.\n\nOverall Value - I definitely got my money's worth here.\n\nWill I return?

Located conveniently near Hwy 60 and Cooper Road, it is in a small industrial building across the street from a nice shopping complex.  I was relieved to learn that EZ Medical Store offers medical equipment for rent or purchase, and that the rental fees for a wheelchair were convenient and reasonable ($35 for a week).  \n\nEven better, they had so many wheelchairs in stock that it was not even necessary for me to reserve a wheelchair in advance. The first time I rented a wheelchair, I walked into the Store, provided my personal information and credit card, and walked out with a wheelchair.  One of the helpful attendants showed me how to open and close the wheelchair for storage, and then carried the wheelchair out to my car for me and placed it into the car (THANK YOU!).  \n\nI was happy enough with the service to rent from them a second time, and this time, one of the managers suggested a scooter rental instead of a wheelchair and so I took home a scooter instead. \n\nAt first, I had been concerned that there would be no way I could get a scooter into my small car, but the manager showed me how easy it was to take apart, and how difficult to break (Ms. Fumbly Fingers here.).  He showed me how to use it, and then with his guidance I took it apart and put it into the trunk of my car (small Toyota) myself so I'd remember how to break it down for transport.\n\nThe real win, the real reason I went to Easy Medical Store made itself apparent when I surprised my Dad with a scooter instead of a wheelchair.  His eyes literally lit up, and the next day, he asked if he could take the scooter for a spin outside, and spend time outside walking with our family.  What a huge relief.  He proceeded to use the scooter nearly every day, which was a relief to our family.  Seeing him active, feeling empowered driving a scooter instead of a wheelchair, and having him get some sun on his face for a couple of days was very important for all of us.  \n\nHad it not been for Easy Medical Store, I would never have considered a scooter, because I thought it would be too big and too expensive for us to manage.

If you weren't looking for it, you would never know it existed as it's located in an industrial-looking business center. We drove past it the first time we went. \n\nOn our first visit, the hubby ordered my all-time favorite plate lunch, Chicken Katsu. It was lightly pan-fried and was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The accompanying sauce was a little different that I have been used to, as it's a little on the sweeter side. I'm used to a more smoky favor, but it was still tasty. So we could try another item on the menu, I ordered the Kalua Pig. It was flavorful, tender, juicy, and not too salty. The plates are served with two scoops of rice and one side (macaroni salad, potato salad, or coleslaw). On the second visit, the hubby again went with the Chicken Katsu, while I ordered their Kahuku Shrimp (mostly because my dad is a Kahuku High School alum, lol). The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice, spicy kick to it. On our most recent visit, I couldn't pass up the Chicken Katsu yet again, so we both ordered it this time. \n\nWhile the restaurant is small, it is clean and has plenty of seating. Service has been friendly and consistent.

If I was rating purely with my mind and not my heart, this would be a four or 3.5 star review (I round up on yelp.) \n\nOn our trip to Pittsburgh, we opted to take the $8 public tour on Friday Oct. 7. This was the only day during our trip a tour was available, for understandable reasons. We arrived early, more than the requested 15 minutes and there was already quite a line. Or at least a couple of different lines, and no one was really sure what was happening. Turns out a tour group that had been scheduled for an earlier tour (students from a local school) was late, causing a major disruption. In fact, they still had people running in AFTER the 10 am tour start time. This caused the tour guides to be quite discombobulated, and the public tours to start late. A minor inconvenience, and not necessarily the fault of Heinz Field or their staff/volunteers, but it definitely didn't start the day off right. \n\nOnce the tour got started, it wasn't too bad. They split the larger group into several smaller ones (still about 40-50 people each) and headed out and around the field. I don't know if it's because they were rushing to make the time back up or what, but there were MANY times the groups ran into each other or got confused during the tour. It seems there could have been better organization there. That being said, the tour moves fast, but does allow you time to take pictures, etc. You see various parts of the seating area, the scoreboards, the press boxes, the luxury boxes and my favorite part - the locker rooms and the field. During this time, you get a lot of information that you can probably find on google, with a little personal commentary from the tour guide's experiences thrown in. \n\nOverall, for a Steelers fan (and one guy married to a Steelers fan) it was an enjoyable experience, despite the organizational snafus. Definitely worth the $8 (which, compared to other stadium tours I've experienced is very reasonable.)", "date": "2016-10-26 16:09:46"}, {"review_id": "YQRlFZsEHpy-EMhY9axOKQ", "user_id": "swptR9HtVBPA2FdtxWoyog", "business_id": "ibf4xvHWD4t1DOOZhidHBg", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Cute and quaint mexican restaurant.

When we entered the works...\n\nIt is HUGE on the inside! there are crazy signs from the 40s and 50s and traffic lights and the coolest copper topped tables. I totally dug it's cavernous feel. Ahhh... and the smell!! of fresh cooking meat!! WHOO HOO!!\n\nWe had to go through a lil line that reminded me of Castles n Coasters and some of the older Taco Bells... hmmm not so cute. but I can see how it could be necessary... I can just imagine how busy this place gets at lunch time with the college just RIGHT over there! \n\nTheir burgers sounded pretty average... terriyaki burger, bacon cheese burgers - there's no crazy toppings that don't make sense like some places... just straight up great burger classics. but WHAT is different about the way the menu looked was that they had a retirement burger?!

But since I couldn't afford the retirement burger, I opted for a 1/2lb patty topped with bacon and cheese.

I buried my burger with mounds of lettuce, mayo, ketchup and some tomatos and tons of pickles... and when i was all done... I could barely fit it in my mouth!

I haven't had such a good burger in a long time!\n\nmy ONLY complaint is that I wasn't sure about the daily meal deals... I didn't see it until the last second! and that the sides are so SMALL!! HUGE ass burgers... lil baby sides! WTF?! and for almost as much as a burger?!?!

There's lockers for 50c or a free coat rack, but its left unattended.  We opted for the secure lockers for 50c.\n\nThe place has 4 levels, and geared mainly for kids.  All the floors are interactive, and there's even a Planetarium on the 2nd floor.  \n\nIt was a good way to kill 3 or 4 hours, and we headed back to our hotel in time to freshen up and get ready for the hockey game.", "date": "2016-02-23 19:22:53"}, {"review_id": "dZVm1P1RwHmVtPLGYlZVJA", "user_id": "LIsQPcQWkZJbdjE0CTc46g", "business_id": "-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We stopped in here one afternoon and they were serving champagne brunch.

The last two times I've been here the service was lousy, downright apathetic, there seemed to be no shortage of servers and wait-staff in the place but they seemingly vanished at times without a trace.    \n\n\nNow the worst part.     The menu was overhauled almost entirely.  Previously it was filled with good stuff, at reasonable prices.

The other driver was not courteous enough to leave a note.  Our secondary concern was damage to the hood (also while unattended in a parking lot but some time earlier).\n\n911 Collision did a reasonable job on the bumper - covered under insurance after our $500 deductible was met.  The color doesn't exactly match but then it doesn't scream out either.  One of the people that works there told me that you can never get the color to match because the bumper is plastic and the body is sheet metal.  I'll go on record now by calling that out as complete hogwash - Detroit, Germany, and Japan do it all day long.  The color might be hard to match for a host of other plausible and legitimate reasons but not because one is metal and the other is plastic.\n\nSo we have established that, at best, the work is mediocre and they like to lie about it.  Now on to the hood.\n\nThe hood was originally quoted as a $1000 correction because they would have to paint the WHOLE FRONT COWL - hood, fenders, grill, bumper, etc.  All for two ding's no larger than a plug nickel.  And $1000 is the REDUCED price because we already had the car in their shop.  Normally it would have been more.\n\nWe decided that was too much and went with Option-B: they pop the dents, wet sand the area and then blend in a little touch up paint, wet sand again to smooth it out, clear the area and wet sand again.  All for $300.  Not bad - right?  Wrong.\n\nIt looks like all they did was pop the dents.  Is still isn't smooth, The scratches are very obvious, and I cant tell that it was wet sanded at all.  I think they just let the shop lackey have a crack at it with the touch up paint you get at Auto Zone.  Had I known that this is what $300 gets me, I would have passed.  It looks Rookie all the way.  See pics I've uploaded to this vendor - they are of a red hood with the still visible scratches in them AFTER the work was completed.\n\nI waited around to discuss it with the shop manager but he was busy and couldn't get around to me.  Eventually I left.  He did call me and offer to \"make it right\" but that didn't involve a discount on the work done and he wanted it back with more money to do more work.  After what had been done already I didn't trust them with any more time or money.  \n\nScore is as follows...\nQuality of the bumper = Three stars\nQuality of the hood = Subtract one star - Now two.\nLies told by employee = Subtract one star - Now only one star.\nWe could keep subtracting but whats the point?\n\nHere is the moral of this story - If your car is worth anything to you, SHOP AROUND FOR SOMEONE ELSE.", "date": "2012-03-01 01:57:32"}, {"review_id": "1KMgc3TEsND-D1OkpMc2pQ", "user_id": "E0ujMO7Brlh4PM-AiG-wSw", "business_id": "fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Amazing!

It has cute homey decor, is right in the neighborhood, and could work for a romantic date or a family night out. I think we've given it four tries now, and sadly, it just seems to be going downhill. The first night we had great service and okay food. I appreciated the eggplant Parmesan, which was bright and not fried. The calamari was decent. And in both of these dishes, the marinara was delicious. On subsequent trips we ventured out and tried picatta and parmigiana style veal or chicken and the meat has been overcooked, tough, and greasy. On the most recent trip with the kids, the marinara sauce seemed to be days old...and not in a good way. My daughter ordered mozzarella sticks that came with this sauce. And I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana again. The eggplant was fine, but the sauce that topped it and the side of spaghetti was thick, dark, and not fresh. There have been problems with the service on all subsequent trips.

Conversion to Sunday brunch would require you to accept the fact that you don't need to wake up early on Sunday, and therefore you can allow yourself to eat something that is heavier than just breakfast. Brunch brings to the table a few things that are worthy of worship such as eggs benedict, bagel & lox, and huevos rancheros. I love the concept as we usually have brunch with our friends, family, or loved ones; hence, brunch builds a sense of community. Jokes apart, going for brunch is one of the highest trends in the Toronto restaurant industry. In the past few months a few fine dining restaurants have added a brunch menu. I have a few favourites in the city but today I will focus on The Saint Tavern.\n\nThe Saint Tavern is located on Ossington St. near Queen St. West. We were a group of four and we arrived at the restaurant around 1:30PM. It was busy but we were lucky enough to get a very comfy table. The decor was modern and charming. Polished cement floors, old looking light fixtures, all black, white, and gray with a very-large-bar.\n\nWe started with the deviled eggs with chives, radish salad, and bacon. It was delicious and we were all fighting to get the last piece. I opted for having their grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomatoes and salad. It was simple but perfect. The strong cheese was balanced by the tomatoes- so yummy! My friends loved their choices and we were all pleased with our waitress. I recall drinking copious amounts of coffee on that day and not eating ANYTHING ELSE after having that meal. \n\nWe spent a few hours at the restaurant and we had a great time! I would love to come back there for another brunch or maybe dinner one day.
