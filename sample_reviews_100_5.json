Once we got into the club, I was so amazed with everything! We sat down and guys were already approaching us with cranberry volka and red bull volka. Yummmm! I'm not going to lie, but that stripper pole is amazing!! Especially because it got really crowded that night because it was the Sunday of labor day weekend. It was so crowded that I was not able to walk anywhere so my friends and I danced at the stripper pole area. These guys approached us to join their VIP table and of course we said yes. :). I had an amazing time! XS always treats me right!\n\nSecond time in Vegas: Friday night, April 5th, 2013. David Guetta was also performing.\nIt was a lot less crowded this time. I was able to get onto the dance floor to see David Guetta up close! It was a wonderful experience. :). \n\nWhat I really like about XS is the pool area. I love how they open the pool so we can soak our feet in it. Come on girls! Being able to take off your heels and soaking them in water feels so good! \n\nXS usually only have an all girls guest list, so make sure your guy friends buy presale tickets to skip the crazy long line! \n\nOh XS also gives girls on the guest list a free complimentary drink! :D", "date": "2013-04-20 07:00:51"}, {"review_id": "mvO6VnNEAxcG2qcRYhiQjQ", "user_id": "0sNAZ--Oh_bXbS-Fff8Gog", "business_id": "d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Love the service, the waitress is so nice and very helpful with all the quest I asked.

Simply delicious.\n\n\"More coffee?\" \n\"Of course!\"\n\nMy coffee was continually topped up by our waitress and never went below the 50% mark.

You can learn about these unique foods from the extremely knowledgable Brett Ottolenghi. He is passionate about the products he carries and the people who make them. I love how everything is so carefully curated.\n\nThe best part of this already amazing place is their new cafe powered by Chef Johnny Church. It's lunch only and there are just six seats available. The menu is fun and exciting, which shouldn't be surprising with the access to great ingredients. There's a Prix Fixe option for $35 (basically a chef tasting menu) or you can order a la carte. We requested a couple items, but left the rest of the decisions up to Chef and we were very pleased with the selections!\n\nCorn and Crab Chowder with Espelette Pepper oil and lime crema ($6). A nice warm broth with a light flavor from corn and a touch of crab meat. I loved the welcoming spice from the Espelette pepper.\n\nLion Fish Ceviche with Coconut and Citrus, served with Tempura Wasabi Leaves ($9). A really fabulous interpretation of ceviche with an unique use of coconut milk. This was my first time trying lion fish and it's great - a clean firm, white fish. Lion fish is dubbed \"one of the most aggressively invasive species on the planet\" and they threaten sea life on our Atlantic coast. Brett is an advocate for their consumption, but it hasn't caught on with chefs in town just yet. Either way, this is a wonderful way to try it! Also, it was my first time with wasabi leaves and those are fantastic as well. \n\nPancakes with Seared Sonoma Foie Gras and Three Grape Gastrique ($12). This is so, so amazing. Individual pancakes with delicious foie gras, a cool group of grapes (like Icicle Grapes) and Vermont maple syrup. This is a fantastic combination!\n\nCrispy Brick Chicken Thigh made with Mary's Pasture-Raised Organic Chicken; served with mushroom bread pudding ($11). This delicious chicken thigh goes through quite the process. The thigh's bone is removed, then flayed before being stuffed with a truffle concoction. Then it's sous vide before getting crisped. The result is a succulent, flavorful chicken with crispy skin. \n\nDuck Fat Fries with Sir Kensington's Ketchup. There's nothing to hate when it comes to cooking things in duck fat. I loved the topping of fried thyme and this natural ketchup is very tasty (of course, a product you can purchase here).\n\nZucchini and Squash \"Spaghetti\" with Tomato, Parmesan, Basil; plus, Housemade Burrata ($12). I make zucchini \"pasta\" at home, so I'm a fan of this preparation. I like that this dish was well seasoned and surprisingly flavorful. The creamy Burrata made it that much better.\n\nHexx Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me with Fennel Pollen and Orange Segments ($4). This has a wonderful texture and richness that's thicker than pudding. I loved the semisweet nature of the chocolate and the orange paired really well.\n\nThey plan to change the menu frequently, so I'm happy to visit just as often. The price point is fantastic and I love the exposure to unique ingredients.\n\nHighly recommended: Lion Fish Ceviche, Pancakes with Seared Foie Gras, and Hexx Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me.", "date": "2015-11-27 22:23:43"}, {"review_id": "RvXBeyiQ-_vrux-DYxHiKw", "user_id": "dEbD0tYCbO1Zw7xM74NMIQ", "business_id": "2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is our go to Chinese restaurant.

Amazingly fast friendly and professional service and the flavors of their arabica coffee are so smooth and satisfying!! I'm quite a regular at this location and they always make it a point to remember us and are so great with my kids! \n\nMy kids love their flavored milks (vanilla is top choice) they love their smoothies soooo much so fresh and flavorful and made with real fruit... They are so great to put whip cream right on the straw for my kids as a fun bonus treat! My kids also love their Italian sodas with lots and lots of flavor choices but we recommend the raspberry with extra cream and whip and especially delicious orange with extra cream and whip!! It's just like an orange creamsicle Y U M! \n\nHere's my fun mommy tip... Don't want to have to get your kids a drink every time you treat yourself to coffee (much needed caffeine lol I have 4 kids 6 and under I know:-) then ask the workers for free \"whip-sticks\" it's just a straw with whip cream on top and it's free and my kids love it! \n\nAnother HUGE thing that DB does over Starbucks is their stamp system!! You get a stamp per drink instead of per transaction!! After 10 stamps you get a FREE drink, any drink you want! They ALSO do promos Alll the time!! You can find them locally, through text, or Facebook... Like New Year's Day they gave 3 stamps per any drink purchase and every Tuesday is double stamp day, two stamps per drink purchase! If you have a crew in your car like me go on tuesdays and  I let my kids get vanilla milks with my coffee purchase and pay less then $10 for 4 drinks and score 8 stamps towards a free drink!!! \n\nLastly favorite drinks are\nIced white zombie (yup they have a \"secret delicious menu\" that they will share with you if you just ask) this drink is a blend of their delish coffee and vanilla and white mocha!! It's rocking no lies!!\n\nHot white grasshopper!! Best holiday season drink! It's a white mocha and smooth mint flavored coffee party in your mouth!!\n\nAnd my favorite on menu drinks are the inhalator (a macadamia nut coffee) try it white!! White inhalator, iced! It's like the macadamia  nut cookies with the white Chocolate chips:)\n\nAnd the Cocomo! Like a mounds bar in a cup!

We threw on some clean clothes and out the door we went.  ...As we pulled up I had just remembered that it was Easter morning - dammit.  They were closed.   So we took a little drive and stumbled upon this diner.  Looked cute, it was busy, so we parked and went in.\n\nWe waited a whole 30 seconds for a table.  THEY HAD MIMOSAS.  Done.  I ordered one.  Joe had some OJ.  They had a cute little menu for breakfast.  One of the dishes that caught my eye was the potato zucchini pancakes...yum!!!!  I didn't order those though :( I did order the special breakfast quiche.  And my oh my was I a happy lady :) You had the option to get either the typical pie crust OR a hasbrown crust.  I decided to walk on the wild side and get the hashbrown crust.  Just delicious!  Joe ordered their french toast, 2 eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns.  The french toast was creamy and delicious.  They make the cinnamon swirl bread that is the main star of the french toast.  Obviously.  He also got a biscuit as a side.  It was the size of a small child and more delicious than I can begin to tell you.  It was tangy, flakey, buttery, chewy...heaven.  We ordered 2 to go.  I also ate them with honey.  Ohm nom nom.\n\nWe were too full to order pie :( that and we had no where to store the pie at.  We were checking out of our hotel that morning and headed back home.  I hear that it is delicous.

Their drop off system works perfectly with a busy work schedule. They have fair pricing and are completely honest. They work with me to figure out major fixes and have never pushed any type of service or fix on me. I completely trust them and so thankful my brother found these guys! \n\nWhen I lived in California and Nevada, I still made sure to have my car's appointment at Hon-man whenever I visited Arizona. When I had a problem in a very remote location in Nevada, I called Tait and he respond back very quickly within the same day! He was patient with me (I'm not car savvy at all, they know this) and asked me to check and listen for certain things.  He explained my fix and he was spot on! Luckily I was able to get my car back to Arizona without any damages so they could look at it. David has also patiently explained to me how to take better care of my car after my appointments and has never rushed through the instructions. Hon-man is the BEST mechanic in the whole world! \n\nThey also have a cute pup named Amy, and a bearded dragon Donald (formerly known as Bruce) you can hang out with while they work on your car. Their garage is always clean, quiet, and comfortable. The waiting room is very nice and they have a really cool fish tank and terrarium. You can tell they take extremely good care of their animals. \n\nNot to digress too much; my point is that Hon-man has really helped me out a lot. Thank you Hon-man!!

If you only see the show, you will enjoy his candor and warmth. However, if you can include the meet and greet, absolutely do it!!  Wayne can still sing, not the powerful amazing voice he had when younger but you can catch that on a cd!  No cd can match getting to know the legend that is Mr Las Vegas!", "date": "2018-07-31 03:57:02"}, {"review_id": "fpcDUG4Bf_6vNtw2qYTAuQ", "user_id": "eyUbG7Ogq_7VCD0oRwM5DA", "business_id": "JrXxQKt-TuHG1-ZjZifa1A", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 3, "cool": 0, "text": "Best Car company ever  Easy when you arrive... go directly to the Emerald Isle and jump in and go.

Look at the beautiful flowers that came to my door today. What a surprise! The bouquet is lovely!!! Thank you both so much. I enjoyed your nice card too. You're so special.\" \nThe text included two smiley faces and a kiss-y face.\n\nCrisis averted. \n\nThank you Blooming Expressions for making me look thoughtful and well prepared.

I didn't come to Vegas to eat sushi. \n\nA quick note re lamb: of the highly-rated vegas buffets that come to mind immediately (bellagio, Wynn, studio b at m resort, and this), wicked spoon and bellagio are the only ones serving leg of lamb on weekdays; none serve rack of lamb except bellagio on weekends. rack of lamb is the only reason I make a trip to bellagio at all--wicked spoon is better in nearly every other culinary regard. \n\nAnd as aptly noted by others, cheapskates beware: they close after lunch and reopen at 5 pm for dinner.
