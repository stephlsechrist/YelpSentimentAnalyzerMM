It's such a mess and so unappealing that I wouldn't be surprised if some people just turn around and leave. Some areas are organized, but the majority of the store seems to have no order whatsoever. There is a nice Starbucks inside the store with a large seating area and windows, which would be a cool spot to hang out or take a break from shopping if the customer service wasn't so horrible there. The filthy bathroom at this Target is what really put me over the edge. Every single stall was trashed. Overflowing toilets, paper and garbage everywhere, flies buzzing around, just completely disgusting! I promptly left after encountering the bathroom situation.\n\nNot one of the better Targets I've been to. I wouldn't recommend it if you are turned off by messy and disorganized stores.

I don't have any, so this is seldom a concern of mine but the swearing, cussing, crude behavior (everybody brags about just peeing where they stand) and just out and out \"trashy\" behavior would really turn off the average guy.  \n\nOne out of every 50 girls should be wearing the bikini's that are everywhere.

Good job XS, I'm back on yelp.  \n\nThis place gets a lot of hype and rightfully so. The venue is what I call a hot girl-crazy paradox.  Since its inception, what's not to love about her? XS is sexy, gorgeous & attractive. Everyone wants to sample it... even if it means paying a premium price, but people (me included) tend to be blind-sighted when their smarter friends warn you otherwise. \n\nChilling in the room, reminiscing how awesome the previous nights were (side note: the wraparound balcony suite at the cosmopolitan deserves a well 10 star out of 5 review... but that's a different story), one of my best friend says, \"hey, we should all go to XS tonight, I'll buy 4 tickets online. Avicii will be there\". Yup, with house/trance being the mainstream these days, when you hear Avicii, Tiesto, or Gareth Emery... people like my friends automatically think it's going to be a good night. \n\nIt was 9:30pm. We did the usual XS protocols. Go in before rush hour to get the usual two stamps... 1) for being 21+ 2) the other for re-entry. I like to address the ladder stamp being the most important. With their low quality stamp ink pads, make sure you get a FULL stamp. Not 1/3... not even half...  not ... but a FULL stamp. Let me repeat that again... a FULL STAMP (like the ones you get at Disneyland)  \n\nLater that night in the re-entry way, the security claims that my stamp wasn't clear enough for the club and that I had to immediately go back to general admission to purchase a new ticket. At that moment, I had the hot girl-crazy paradox epiphany... the illusion glass of hotness suddenly shattered and my realization of XS began.\n\n \n1) XS's extra small dance floor\n2) XS's poor handle of crowd control\n3) XS's poor quality in bottle services \n4) XS's $19 red bull vodkas\n5) XS's poor judgment in the definition of Excess. \n\n\nLike a hot-crazy girl, if you haven't experienced XS yet, you have to try it. It's something everyone must do and say, \"yup... I done it\"; however, if the next time is going to be your 10th... stop while you're ahead. Keep the legendary memories behind you and don't let it get tainted with the XS it is now: overcrowded, overpriced and most of all... overhyped. \n\nI'm back Yelpers.

Did I upset the Food Gods? No idea but I sure did have hell of a lunch date! My date and I arrived at therapy around 2 o'clock to try the beautiful and delicious food we had previously discovered on Yelp. When we walked in we were immediately greeted and sat at a table. Our waiter was a beautiful young lady with dark brown hair that was also working the bar. She went over the menu with us because we were new customers, which I appreciate and took our drink and food order. The food literally took 30 to 45 minutes to cook because we had to leave right when the food came out to go pay for an additional hour for our parking. That was very inconvenient and a bit frustrating the fact that lunch was fairly empty but I guess that's what you get when you go to a restaurant that cooks fresh food. My partners ordered the famous burger and I settled for the red velvet waffle chicken sandwich. The host that greeted us at the door delivered our food. \n\n     My face frowned when I looked at my plate. The waffles were obviously very burnt inside and out having a black coating and a smoky smell. I immediately pulled out my phone and compared pictures on the same plate that other people had ordered on YELP & I noticed that everyone else is waffle was a bright red or bright pink color without the burnt glaze. My partner asked me, \"Are your waffles burnt??\". He waved down who seemed to be the manager on duty. Heavyset Caucasian male over to the table. I politely pointed at the waffles and asked to get a new batch because I received burnt waffles. I had already tried to scarf it down and cover it with mad syrup, but it did no justice. \n\n     What made me feel a certain type of way is the fact that the manager sat there and to my face explained that the waffles were not burnt and that they just come that way. The hell.... I don't know if he was trying to be funny or he was blatantly being an a****** looking me dead in my face telling me that these burnt rectangles are perfectly fine. I think he was trying to make me feel stupid!!! But he insisted on making a new batch for me. 7 - 10 minutes later I receive a new batch of red velvet waffles and just as the ones before had a charcoal coat. It. Tasted. Burnt and unappetising. I put all the waffles to the side and simply at the juicy chicken and left hungry. The bartender then came over to check on us. She asked his our food was, but before we could even answer she asked me \" Are those burnt???\" I shrugged and told her that the manager said they can't this way. She looked at the kitchen and said \"oh..\" And walked away with a scrunched face back to the bar. When we were done eating we never were given our check because our waiter, the bartender was busy.

The man was speaking so quickly there was no time to even ask questions, and finally I told him I needed a second opinion before going through with all of this extra maintenance.

I've had lots of Mediterranean food and I need it to meet downtown Toronto standards. While the total of two wraps was around $10, they weren't filling at all.  The falafel wrap only had two falafels and I had to ask them to put hummus on it.  I thought hummus was a standard for a falafel wrap. What's even stranger is that they put the hummus on after all the toppings.  That's just odd.  While the wrap looked big, I had to eat through at least 1/3 wrap before getting to the toppings.  \n\nThe grilled veggie wrap was also mostly bread and very little taste to it as well (and I don't even add salt to most of home made meals, I just add natural spices).  \n\nI went into the \"La Mill express\" section of the place and I figure two wraps should be easy enough to make.  It still took about 10-12 minutes.  Honestly, if the food was better and more filling (i.e. more nutrients instead of bread), I wouldn't mind at all, but when I basically end up eating bread with a side of veggies and two falafels for $10, it's kind of annoying.

The service however is a bit uncomfortable with what feels like teenage girls in skimpy nurse outfits serving you. Of course the men will still look but it gets weirder when you realize you have the option to be spanked by these young girls. My thoughts on the food are pretty basic and extremely unhealthy. The menu includes the Quadruple Bypass Burger, Quintuple Bypass Burger, Sextuple Bypass Burger, Septuple Bypass Burger, and the Octuple Bypass Burger. These dishes range in weight from half a pound to four pounds of beef. Also on the menu are Flatliner Fries (cooked in pure lard) and the Coronary Dog, Lucky Strike no filter cigarettes, alcohol, Butterfat Milkshakes and full sugar Coca-Cola. For the money you're investing in this meal it is not really worth it for the plain tasting food. My opinion is the Heart Attack Grill is a place that's fun only to say that you've been. However this restaurant is not for the faint of heart. Their moto is \"Eat, Drink, and Smoke their way to Better Health\".

The contents of the Chimi were ground beef, rice and beans, and the fried burrito was topped with the creamy white cheese. The cheese gave the dish the most flavor. No spice, no real taste of seasoning. The cheese had made the crispy fried tortilla a little soggy. The rice was just orange and flavorless. The sour cream helped a little on the Chimi, but only a little. These simple Chimis were $11, on a Sunday at 12:30. Most everything else on the menu started at $15.\n\nThe iced tea was fine, and the server kept it filled.

I was ecstatic when they opened right across from my work in Uptown. Unfortunately, I have to say the quality of food & customer service at the this location has significantly declined. This morning was the fourth time in a row I was disappointed. My breakfast sandwich had the bare minimum of ingredients (so little cheese I actually had to check after a few bites) & also cold- it was not busy so not sure why. The other times I've visited lately, the sandwiches I had were subpar at best, one even had bacon that was pretty burnt- had to pick it off to eat. As far as customer service, the baristas are on their own time. After waiting 25 minutes the other night for a quick coffee, I had them change my order to tea & just ate the price difference, so I could just get a hot drink & go, as I had somewhere to be & couldn't continue to wait around. Perhaps they should focus on their job instead of chatting with other employees. This is not the quality I'm used to from Amelie's nor worth the price, which I hate to say.

I was really looking forward to the buttery fattiness, but found it entirely flavorless and stale (the ends were hard which I've never experience with sushi). To be honest , I choked down the uni. Sad because it's one of my favorites to order. It had an odd metallic flavor that again, I've never experienced. Additionally, the nigiri itself was really sloppy.

I was over on this side of town and remembered that Starbucks was have a customer appreciation day today between 2PM and 5PM where you could get a BOGO Carmel Cream Latte, Peppermint Mocha Latte, or a Gingerbread man Latte.  I thought this would be a perfect time to utilize my gift card that I received from my Secret Santa so me and bf merrily go into the store.  Everyone knows that when Starbucks throws deals like this then there is going to be a crowd...this was expected.  We placed our orders (mine a Peppermint Moca and his the Carmel Cream Latte) and I used my gift card.

Well she must didn't care what she told her b/c she must have kept doing exactly what she was doing before...making drinks out of order.  There was a couple in front of us and she handed the female her coffee and instead of making the one for the man she was with she makes my bf his coffee.  Well quite naturally the man picks up the coffee thinking it's his, even went so far as to place a cozy on the cup, and once he had turned the coffee several times and read what it was he then realized that it wasn't his.  By this time she had made mine (still the guy is waiting on his drink).  I took mine, picked up the one that the guy had and asked her to remake this one.  \"Why\" she says with a slight attitude.  I gave it right back to her and if you have read any of my other reviews you will know that I do not like my food or drink to be breathed over/picked up by strangers...and this is what I told her.  So she starts making another coffee (I'm thinking she's remaking the bf) but she's making a drink for someone who is farther down the line (still the guy in front of us is waiting and he's getting pissed off).  Then she makes my bf (so he gets his before the guy in front of us) and kinda shoves it to him.
