# YelpSentimentAnalyzerMM

Our Yelp Sentiment Analyzer processes Yelp reviews to predict the star ranking a user assigned a business based on the text in his or her review. It is important, especially during these uncertain times of isolation, because it will help small business owners target what their clientele is looking for when they use their services. By analyzing reviews, it becomes clear to business owners where there is room for improvement and where to focus their efforts. In the report found in this repository, we will first discuss the project goal and problem it is solving. Next, we will go over a high-level description of the Yelp Sentiment Analyzer to describe how we are attempting to solve the described problem. Then we discuss outside research done that relate to our project. Subsequently, we will go into the specifics of our implementation, including what was done and by whom. Finally, the results of our project will be evaluated.
