NEVER AGAIN.\n\nFirst morning, standing in ankle deep water in the shower stall (my first stay here back in 2006 this happened EVERY OTHER DAY). Grout in the shower stall was over abundant with mold, and NEVER cleaned.\nThe toilet handle had to be held down for more than five seconds to flush correctly.\nNow, I am somewhat hairy (not as hairy as a Bigfoot, but it does come off in the shower), and for four out of the eight days, I found my own hair on the floor and walls of the shower stall. So much for a daily cleaning. At least five out of seven days, my room wasn't cleaned until nearly five o'clock....\n\nKeep in mind that I SUPPOSEDLY had VIP status (we booked a block of 10 rooms, and they dropped half the bill on my AMEX card).\n\nOn the first morning of the convention, I noticed that my iron was missing, so I called the front desk for a replacement. After an hour of waiting for it to arrive, I had to leave or I would have missed the opening of our booth (we were exhibiting at CES). So I show up in a wrinkled shirt my first day. I was NOT happy.\n\nMany more problems occured that also appeared in 2006, and I will not even go into the fact that they ended up being paid for a room twice for five out of eight days (not my room, or money, so...).\n\nNEEDLESS TO SAY, I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN, AND I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE COMING TO VEGAS.\n\nAND THEY STOLE THE CHANGE I HAD BEEN BUILDING UP FOR FIVE DAYS!\nI do understand that most hotels look at money left on the desk as a \"tip\", but the better hotels have envelopes for tips, and also have more honest employees!\n\nWhy did they wait until my last night to seal from me?

Not only did it take 4 days to get his vehicle back, the technician then explained there was a computer programming error that Ford was not aware of....  Until NOW.  It's not the $300 we spent to have it reprogrammed, it's the fact that Ford now knows what the error is and will be prepared when this happens to the next customer.\nI have always been a strong supporter of Ford, but seeing the lack of regard for their customers time and inconvenience, we will look elsewhere when purchasing our next new vehicle next month.  \nLastly, when the car was in the service center, it was returned to us with a different iPhone cord.  Now we have a broken cord and what appears to be a poorly manufactured car.  I hope this saves someone some trouble in the future.\nUPDATE: 6/12/17- My husband spoke with the manager, who initially offered to assist due to a previous message that was sent...

We were ALL ready for the check. \n\nManager Joseph brought a fresh jack n pepsi for me, and the massive waste of food we left over is available for viewing in my \"AFTER\" photos attached to this review. .. \n\nHey LOLo, if I wanted to pay for bad service I'd check out this place called \"Dicks\" where apparently some good (albeit vulgar) jargon is tossed at you on purpose... but I'd bet they could make a better plate of chicken n waffles even if they had their petrified grandpappy working the deep fat fryer in the back.... Too honest? Perhaps... but sadly this EXACTLY was what we experienced...

I'll take a different approach and make a list just in case an employee there reads this and decides to help the restaurant out.\n\n1) Service with a smile:  It only takes 1 bad seed to ruin the whole crop. I've been here a few times because my friends enjoy this place (?), but the service here just doesn't fit any other sushi restaurant I've EVER been to. It says \"60 minute limit\" on their menu. They really must stick to the T on this one because after 60 minutes, they just ignore you and forget what you ordered.\n\n2) Flava-flaaaav!:  Hit or miss when it comes to the freshness of their fish.  Sometimes it's on, sometimes it's off.  Whenever I ordered my AYCE anywhere else, I get half orders (4 pieces instead of 8) just because I want to taste everything.  It's a recession, but it ain't worth giving someone the stomach flu or worst!\n\n3) HGTV: Watch it! Give the place a face lift with some paint or decorations. Some traditional Japanese lamps are always decorative. When my friends and I eat here, we're like 20 deep. We get the tables in the middle of restaurant put together and they're uneven and we're on display for everyone to see. I'm charging for pictures next time.\n\nHope this helps everyone.

He was like \"Oh there is definitely a lot of crisis in that area.\"  I was unsure what he meant by this, I took this as he was passing judgement on the population that resides in that area because that I said help people all over Allegheny County who are experiencing crisis's.  What really put the nail in the coffin was at the end of consultation, we are proceeding out of his office when he turns to me and says don't have anymore children. I was extremely offended about this. 1. I have never birth any children, 2. He was judging me by the way my body looked. 3. What if I was a woman who was trying to have children but I had suffered miscarriages. I honestly felt he was trying to turn me off intentionally, I truly was surprised that this individual with such prestige was so insensitive and rude.", "date": "2017-11-14 14:23:21"}, {"review_id": "d-mvLxGuEb2dq8Y1FeUAqw", "user_id": "rv6X1P5gvYFULMAfYALQ_A", "business_id": "prItzs_hMVptn34LxBDN7Q", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "I recently went to this Bank of America branch to address the concern that I have with Bank of America in general and the way that they are continuously charging fees\n\nI walked in and the person at the front who greets the customers stayed on the phone the entire time while I was waiting to be seen by either a teller or a personal banker which ever one could solve my problem.  I waited for him to finish up his phone call, during that period of time he was joking and laughing with the person on the phone and not talking business,  so right away I could tell that this is going to be a waste of time. I should've walked out right there but I was stupid and stayed around.\n\nNext I was seated with a personal banker who had a dual appointment with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.\n\nI gave him my ATM card and asked that he look up my accounts. I have three checking accounts with Bank of America and one savings.  I wanted to see if there was a way I could still keep one of my smaller checking account even though I wasn't going to have a minimum $1500 in that account at all times.  I was experiencing an $18 per month fee which would basically make the account pointless because I was going to be paying more in fees than I was getting out of it.  I keep that checkbook in my bag to pay simple league fees for shooting.  Even though it's been years since I was in college, Bank of America made simple modifications in the past and changed this small account over to campus edge checking.  I find out it has done away with that now because they just want more fees.  Don't make enough money and they want to squeeze their customers more?\n\nThe only thing that this guy wanted to do was help me move my brokerage accounts and my profit-sharing and 401(k) over from Wells Fargo. I told him that I just wanted to avoid the $18 per month checking account fee on this 16 year old account THEN he had to get up and go talk to a branch manager. He came back he said that he and the branch manager talked about it because I don't have direct deposit or the minimum amount that they wanted that there was no way that they can help me.  It was basically ridiculous and Bank of America sucks for charging continuous fees for a customer that they have had since the 1990s.  If it wasn't so much trouble for me to change banks I would do it then I'd have to figure out a way to notify all of the companies that I have making automatic debits from my other checking accounts.

Our small group of two made an order of calamari to be followed with a 10 Oz peppercorn steak with Fries for my wife and I chose something a bit lighter with a steak salad.  First let's start off with the calamari.  If you wanted want to call Costo freshly frozen calamari that was deep fried then seemingly hastily thrown onto some tomato based sauce restaurant quality we may have a difference of opinion.  I was hungry and didn't care that it tasted like prechewed 5 cent bubble gum from when I was a kid.  But moving along.  The main event... my steak salad first... the steak wasn't half bad.. cooked to order (medium) and delicately sliced and plated on a salad bonanza... however after looking closely, I realized that this salad was seemingly the exact composition of the prepackaged salad I can by at Sobey's.... coincidence... possibly.... my wife on the other hand had a very different experience.  Her 10 ounce peppercorn steak which was ordered as medium well was essentially still mooing at her during the first cut and oozing juices.  That and also the peppercorn sauce that was advertised was actually HP sauce with random peppercorns.  We eventually had to flag down a waitress to have them refire the steak, where they asked my wife to place her steak on a separate plate rather then take the entire plate away to correct the issue.  Upon return, the steak was correct however the waitress promptly removed the remaining plate and food from my wife to replace it with the steak alone... no sides...  at this point I think we both had our fill.  Chuck's has an OK atmosphere and staff are definately trying but the food has a lot to be desired when there are so many other options on the other side of the highway.", "date": "2016-03-25 01:55:11"}, {"review_id": "nYlcF_XDOiKTsqZR6mHIVw", "user_id": "-83s33R6DAJKlc6C5Wqzwg", "business_id": "o80WsixApYT1enf3AH6N2Q", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This restaurant looks very clean.

I bought a home, and needed to furnish a bedroom. I decided to shop at Living Spaces in Scottsdale. \nThey advertise being able to deliver same day, even on line. All that is required, is you order before 4 pm.\nI made my purchase on a Thursday, and was told my items wouldn't be available till the following Monday. I didn't think too much of it because I was in no real hurry. \nWhen Monday came, my furniture was delivered at approximately 9:30 am. After the installers were here for about one half hour, I was told that the bed was missing a part necessary for assembly, and left. They said they would contact customer service. \nI call customer service myself in frustration, because I noticed the installers didn't deliver the mattress. \nThe customer service lady told me she had been contacted by her installers, and someone would be at my home by midnight at the latest to deliver the missing parts, and assemble the bed. I also told her that the mattress wasn't delivered. She said I'd have it also by midnight. \nI reminded her that her company boasts about being able to deliver same day, and asked her to account for that. She couldn't. She did waive the $100.00 delivery fee. \nAbout an hour later, the same installers arrived with my mattress. They said they forgot!\nI'm an early to bed, early to rise kind of guy. Not only can't I go anywhere all day. I can't go to sleep when I want to. \nDon't get me wrong, $100.00 is not bad, I just think my time is worth more.  \nIf you should go to Living Spaces, make sure you press them to live up to their claims. It's theirs, and as far as I'm concern, they will live up to it!\nThe delivery arrived at about 7:30 pm. They had the parts needed to complete the bed. After about 10 minutes, one of the men asked me if I had any tools. I provided him with a cordless drill, and the job was done. Approximately 10 minutes after that, the head guy told me that the bed needed to have a solid base, because this \"Kennedy\" bed does not require a box spring. He said the Four 4 \"slats\" the bed came with were too far apart, and the mattress would ripple in time with the slats in place. He went on to advise me that if it were him, he would require a solid base, such as ply wood. As a result, he said he would not be able to install the mattress. The two men returned my tools and departed. \nI called customer service, and told them my dilemma. After explaining my situation, I was told that I needed a \"bunkie board\", at a cost of $70.00. Additionally, I was told it would not be available till Saturday. \nAfter a lot of complaining, the cost was reduced to $35.00, then free. \nAgain. If you shop there make sure they have everything in place, in stock before you pay them.\nI forget to mention, the night stand I ordered, never came with the four posts that hold a shelf up. I called customer service, and told them I was missing them. They assured me they would be sent, via UPS. It's approximately 4 weeks later. Still haven't received them. Another wild promise.
